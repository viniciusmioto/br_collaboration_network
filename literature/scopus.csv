By applying thresholds to network centralities, a core group of countries can be distinguished as part of the international collaboration network. A frequently used keywords analysis found that the priority in assessment would gradually change from project environmental impact assessment (EIA) to strategic environmental assessment (SEA). Decision-theoretic approaches (i.e., environmental indicator selection, life cycle assessment, etc.), along with new technologies and methods (i.e., the geographic information system and modeling) have been widely applied in the EA research field over the past 20. years. Hot spots such as ""biodiversity"" and ""climate change"" have been emphasized in current EA research, a trend that will likely continue in the future. The h-index has been used to evaluate the research quality among countries all over the world, while the improvement of developing countries' EA systems is becoming a popular research topic. Our study reveals patterns in scientific outputs and academic collaborations and serves as an alternative and innovative way of revealing global research trends in the EA research field. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",218

Our analysis reveals the authorial, institutional, spatiotemporal, and categorical patterns in biodiversity research and provides an alternative demonstration of research advancements, which may serve as a potential guide for future research. The growth of article outputs has exploded since the 1990s, along with an increasing collaboration index, references, and citations. Ecology, environmental sciences, biodiversity conservations, and plant science were most frequently used subject categories in biodiversity studies, and Biological Conservation, Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, Conservation Biology and Biodiversity and Conservation were most active journals in this field. The United States was the largest contributor in global biodiversity research, as the U. S. produced the most single-country and collaborative articles, had the greatest number of top research institutions, and had a central position in collaboration networks. We perceived an increasing number of both internationally collaborative and inter-institutionally collaborative articles, with the latter form of collaboration being more prevalent than the former. A keyword analysis found several interesting terminology preferences, confirmed conservation's central position as a topic in biodiversity research, revealed the adoption of advanced technologies, and demonstrated keen interest in both the patterns and underlying processes of ecosystems.

However, a global picture of the research carried out on this topic does not exist. The aim of this study is to identify the worldwide trends in rural depopulation scientific production over time in the main levels of analysis: sources, authors and documents. A bibliometric analysis was developed to analyse a final sample of 1150 articles published between 1979 and 2018. In order to develop the analysis, bibliometrix R-Tool was used and the metadata of two databases (WoS and Scopus) was retrieved and merged. Results show two major areas of co-citation networks; a poor network of collaboration between countries with some highlighted interaction; an author collaboration network with close groups of knowledge and two main themes resulting from a co-word analysis. The main conclusion is that rural depopulation is not yet a solid field of research and the most important themes identified are related to specific geographical areas. However, international collaborations are growing, new trends appearing, and other related fields are expressing greater interest in rural depopulation, which could indicate the preceding stage to an eventual consolidation of the theme. This finding can assist future research in this or related fields by providing a worldwide overview of rural depopulation research over time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",176

Groundwater is also used for agricultural irrigation and for the domestic supply of drinking water in most nations. However, groundwater contamination has led to many research efforts on groundwater remediation technologies and strategies. This study evaluated a total of 5486 groundwater remediation-related publications from 1995 to 2015 using bibliometric technology and social network analysis, to provide a quantitative analysis and a global view on the current research trend and future research directions. Our results underline a strong research interest and an urgent need to remediate groundwater pollution due to the increasing number of both groundwater contamination and remediation publications. In the past two decades, the United States (U.S.) published 41.1% of the papers and it was the core country of the international collaboration network, cooperating with the other 19 most productive countries. Besides the active international collaboration, the funding agencies also played positive roles to foster the science and technology publications. With respect to the analysis of the distribution of funding agencies, the National Science Foundation of China sponsored most of the groundwater remediation research. We also identified the most productive journals, Environmental Science and Technology and Journal of Contaminant Hydrology, which published 334 and 259 scientific articles (including research articles and reviews) over the past 20 years, respectively. In addition to journal publications, a patent analysis was performed to show the impact of intellectual property protection on journal publications. Three major remediation technologies, including chemical oxidation, biodegradation and adsorption, have received increasing interest in both journal publication and patent development. Our results provide a valuable reference and global overview to identify the potential obstacles and opportunities for researchers who currently work on groundwater contamination, remediation and related topics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",157

Landslide-related research has undergone notable growth during the past two decades. Multidisciplinary Geosciences, Geological Engineering, and Water Resources were the three major science categories, and Geomorphology was the most active journal during the surveyed period. The major author clusters and research regions are located in North America, Western Europe, and East Asia. The USA was a leading contributor to global landslide research, with the most independent and collaborative articles, and its dominance was also confirmed in the national/regional collaboration network. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, US Geological Survey, and Italian National Research Council were the three major contributing institutions. Guzzetti F from the Italian National Research Council was the most productive author, with the most high-quality articles. A keyword analysis found that landslide susceptibility assessment, rainfall- and earthquake-induced landslide stability, and effective research technologies and methods were consistent topics that attracted the most attention during the study period. Several keywords, such as “landslide susceptibility”, “earthquake”, “GIS”, “remote sensing”, and “logistic regression”, received dramatically increased attention during the study period, possibly signalling future research trends. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",103

Impact assessments represent a key tool in identifying and predicting the environmental consequences of a project. The journal Environmental Impact Assessment Review started promoting research discussing different issues or methods in the field of impact assessments and environmental management since 1980. By analyzing 1664 articles published within the journal between 1980 and 2018 by 2935 authors, affiliated to institutions from 75 countries, this study aims to provide a better understanding of the environmental assessment research trends. Bibliometric indicators such as keywords or country of affiliation were analyzed through a network methodological approach, including co-occurrence analysis, centrality metrics and multiple correspondence analysis. The international collaboration and productivity maps bring a novel overview to this type of analysis and reveal new perspectives for thrived cooperation on environmental assessments research. The results illustrate the most common research topics through a conceptual structure map and a keywords co-occurrence graph with a temporal overlay, which allows observing their evolution over the years. Furthermore, this work tries to explain the political, economic, social and technological factors that influence the tendencies in environmental assessments research and scientific cooperation, providing future insights for environmental scientific priorities. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",83

In this study, a total of 8,570 papers from 15 core journals during the period of 2000-2011 were collected. The results indicate that 66 % of papers are joint publications in global LIS. Two-country papers and two-institution papers are the two primary collaboration patterns in the international collaboration at the country and institution levels respectively. Through social network analysis, it is observed that the country collaboration network has reached a certain degree of maturity over the past 12 years in global LIS, while the international institution collaboration network has not yet matured and is made up of dozens of components. In the country collaboration network, the position of USA and UK are remarkable. Although the USA is positioned at the center of the network, institutions located in the USA are more inclined to have collaboration within domestic, suggesting institutions in the USA have a low tendency towards international collaboration. In the institution collaboration network, it is found that two groups located in the USA and Europe respectively.

Mobile health (mHealth) has emerged as a field of research with increasing attention being paid to it by scientific researchers and a rapid increase in related literature being reported. Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the current state of research, including publication outputs, in the field of mHealth to uncover in-depth collaboration characteristics and topic burst of international mHealth research. Methods: The authors collected literature that has been published in the last 20 years and indexed by Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Various statistical techniques and bibliometric measures were employed, including publication growth analysis; journal distribution; and collaboration network analysis at the author, institution, and country collaboration level. The temporal visualization map of burst terms was drawn, and the co-occurrence matrix of these burst terms was analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis and social network analysis. Results: A total of 2704 bibliographic records on mHealth were collected. The earliest paper centered on mHealth was published in 1997, with the number of papers rising continuously since then. A total of 21.28% (2318/10,895) of authors publishing mHealth research were first author, whereas only 1.29% (141/10,895) of authors had published one paper. The total degree of author collaboration was 4.42 (11,958/2704) and there are 266 core authors who have collectively published 53.07% (1435/2704) of the total number of publications, which means that the core group of authors has fundamentally been formed based on the Law of Price. The University of Michigan published the highest number of mHealth-related publications, but less collaboration among institutions exits. The United States is the most productive country in the field and plays a leading role in collaborative research on mHealth. There are 5543 different identified keywords in the cleaned records. The temporal bar graph clearly presents overall topic evolutionary process over time. There are 12 important research directions identified, which are in the imbalanced development. Moreover, the density of the network was 0.007, a relatively low level. These 12 topics can be categorized into 4 areas: (1) patient engagement and patient intervention, (2) health monitoring and self-care, (3) mobile device and mobile computing, and (4) security and privacy. Conclusions: The collaboration of core authors on mHealth research is not tight and stable. Furthermore, collaboration between institutions mainly occurs in the United States, although country collaboration is seen as relatively scarce. The focus of research topics on mHealth is decentralized. Our study might provide a potential guide for future research in mHealth. © Lining Shen, Bing Xiong, Wei Li, Fuqiang Lan, Richard Evans, Wei Zhang.",69

The paper covered the past three decades of publications and carried out performance analysis and science mapping analysis of articles. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses bibliometrics, performance analysis and science mapping analysis of 1,016 articles extracted from the Scopus database. The study examined the scientific productivity of articles, productive authors, citable documents, most relevant institutions, cited countries, co-occurrence of keywords, thematic mapping, co-citations and collaboration of authors and countries. The study used Biblioshiny as a tool to carry out the performance analysis and science mapping analysis. Findings: The results show that the number of publications has significantly increased in the past decade, 88.4% of authors contribute at least a single article, 8.3% of authors published two articles, 2% of the authors published three documents and 0.6% of the authors contribute four papers. The USA, China and Australia were the most productive countries in terms of the total number of citations and foreign collaborations. Journal of Knowledge Management, Knowledge Management Research and Practice, VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management and International Journal of Technology Management are the top outlets in the knowledge management literature.

This study examines the hypothesis that geographically diverse scientific collaboration is associated with research impact. Here, the approach is differentiated from other studies by: (a) focusing on publications rather than researchers or institutes; (b) considering the geographical diversity of authors of each publication; (c) considering the average number of citations a publication receives per year (time-based normalization of citations) as a surrogate for its impact; and (d) not focusing on a specific country (developed or developing) or region. Analysis of the collected bibliometric data shows that a publication impact is significantly and positively associated with all related geographical collaboration indicators. But publication impact has a stronger association with the numbers of external collaborations at department and institution levels (inter-departmental and inter-institutional collaborations) compared to internal collaborations. Conversely, national collaboration correlates better with impact than international collaboration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",54

The result shows that only 4.43% of the research by LIS authors from Africa were funded while only 8.16% were published in Africa. The study further shows that the visibility of the articles was low as they attracted 0.67 citation per year. Single author papers declined by the year, while collaboration increased. Institutional collaboration was the most popular while intra-Africa collaboration was the least popular. Furthermore, articles that were funded, published outside Africa, and from intra-African and international collaborations were more cited. International collaborations where LIS authors from Africa were lead authors attracted less citations. The observable differences in citations received by different funding status, collaboration types, publication place and authors’ role were statistically significant. Though higher visibility and funding through international collaboration as revealed in this study is a positive incentive for authors from Africa to participate in international collaboration, it is important to also improve intra-African collaboration. Through strong intra-African collaboration networks, innovative research could be driven to solve some of the problems facing Africa. It was also recommended that structures that will promote intra-African and international collaboration should be provided with funding opportunities. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",53

In the current context, the development of an adequate costing system is of extreme importance in organisations because they feel the need to properly manage the resources at their disposal and control their costs to achieve efficient and effective management. Thus, this study aims to analyse international publications on the activity-based costing system in recent years, identifying trends in evolution and future research opportunities. Based on bibliometric techniques, the outputs obtained in theWeb of Science (n = 752) and Scopus (n = 1107) databases were analysed in bibliometrix R package to make a systematic mapping and review of the literature. After removing duplicates, we obtained a final output of 1419 articles. The analysis of these publications points to a growing trend in the publication of articles on ABC, highlighting publications in partnership and their dispersion in magazines from different areas. The bibliometric analysis carried out results on the authors’ global research performance over time, and we highlighted the pioneering publications every five years and analysed the general evolution. When analysing based on publication authors over time, we highlighted the main research themes and countries where studies had been carried out. On the other hand, we also highlighted the collaborative network between institutions, authors, and countries over time. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",53

With extremely scarce resources and limited academic freedom as starting points, researchers in this region have been creating new knowledge; they have been building on rich scientific traditions in selected disciplines and, at times, paving new paths in non-traditional disciplines. At present, the cumulative contribution of post-Soviet countries to global research output is only three percent, indicating that these countries are not key players on the global research scene. This study uses bibliometric methods to offer novel empirical insight into the quantity and impact of academic publications; it also looks at the quality of journals in which the output is published. The findings reveal that fifteen post-Soviet countries differ considerably in terms of how much they have prioritised research, as well as the quantity, quality, and impact of their publications. The research productivity across the region has not been high and, taken together, these countries have produced publications of considerably lower quality and lower impact when viewed in the context of global research output. At the same time, researchers from post-Soviet countries tap into international collaborative networks actively, resulting in an exceptionally large proportion of publications from this region being internationally co-authored. In the historical context of Soviet research being known as one of the least collaborative globally, this finding indicates that researchers in the region are attractive to international collaborators and may be seeking such partnerships due to relatively modest research capacity at home. © 2021, The Author(s).",47

The first step in this study is using complex networks to visualize and analyze these articles. CiteSpace and Gephi were employed to generate a countries collaboration network and a disciplines collaboration network, and then attached hot topics to countries and disciplines, respectively. The results show that USA, China, and Italy are the three major contributors to natural disaster research. “Prediction model”, “social vulnerability”, and “landslide inventory map” are three hot topics in recent years. They have attracted attention not only from large countries like China but also from small countries like Panama and Turkey. Comparing two hybrid networks provides details of natural disaster research. Scientists from USA and China use image data to research earthquakes. Indonesia and Germany collaboratively study tsunamis in the Indian Ocean. However, Indonesian studies focus on modeling and simulations, while German research focuses on early warning technology. This study also introduces an activity index (AI) and an attractive index (AAI) to generate time evolution trajectories of some major countries from 2000 to 2013 and evaluate their trends and performance. Four patterns of evolution are visible during this 14-year period. China and India show steadily rising contributions and impacts, USA and England show relatively decreasing research efforts and impacts, Japan and Australia show fluctuating activities and stable attraction, and Spain and Germany show fluctuating activities and increasing impacts. © 2018 Shen et al.

The need for more sustainable urban infrastructures led to many research efforts on innovative technologies and development strategies. We analyzed research progress on sustainable urban infrastructure from 1991 to 2017 using bibliometric, keyword co-occurrence and document cocitation network analysis. An increasing publication number suggests a rapid development of the sustainable urban infrastructure research area, but the development is still in an emerging stage. With respect to the analysis of research themes, we analyzed keyword co-occurrence networks in the three stages of 1991-1999, 2000-2008, and 2009-2017. We observed substantial expansions and intensive interconnections of research theme clusters on sustainable urban infrastructure. The themes from 2009 to 2017 include “critical infrastructure,” “urban planning and design,” “development need,” “technology innovation,” and “cyber-physical system.” The United States produced 28.93% of the publications and played a core role in the international collaboration network. We further compared national interests among top productive countries, which highlights different priorities of investing more sustainable urban infrastructures. Finally, we presented an in-depth analysis of four emerging technology innovations, namely, renewable energy, smart grid, green infrastructure, and cloud computing regarding research directions and challenges.

The number of DEM-related publications has been continuously increasing since 1994. Geology, engineering, and physical geography were the most frequently used subject categories in DEM-related studies, whereas Geomorphology, International Journal of Remote Sensing, and IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing were the most active journals in the field. Toutin, T., Favalli, M., and Hancock, G. R. were the most prolific authors in DEM-related research. Authors of DEM-related research were mostly located in the USA, the European Union, and East Asia. The USA, China, and the UK were the top three most productive countries. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the largest contributor of single-institution and collaborative publications on DEM, has a key position in collaboration networks. Both the number of articles that are internationally and inter-institutionally collaborative is increasing, with the former being more prevalent than the latter.

IRFA also experienced substantial growth in its authors' collaboration network. U.K. and U.S. authors are the journal's most frequent contributors. We use regression analysis to identify article age, a special issue, lead article, European author affiliation, title length and novelty, and the number of authors, figures, keywords, and references as critical predictors of IRFA's citations. Finally, using STM, we find that IRFA's conceptual structure reflects 12 major topics with corporate ownership and governance, and stock market volatility and spillover as the most prominent.

After a brief review of their definitions, we introduce the concepts of external and internal inter-group geodesics. These concepts are applied to a collaboration network of 1129 researchers from different countries, which is based on publications in bibliometrics, informetrics, webometrics, and scientometrics (BIWS in short) from the period 1990-2009. It is thus illustrated how international collaboration (among authors from different countries) in BIWS is carried out. Our results suggest that average scores for local Q-measures are typically higher, indicating a relatively low degree of international collaboration in BIWS. The dominating form of international collaboration is bilateral, whereas multilateral collaboration is relatively rare in the field of BIWS. We also identify and visualize the most important global and local actors. Dividing the entire period in four 5-year periods, it is found that most international collaboration in the field has happened in the last time slice (2005-2009). A comparison of the different time slices reveals the non-linear growth of the indicators studied and the international expansion of the field. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",46

Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of formulation based on a bibliometric analysis of Spanish university production from 2000 to 2004 as contained in Web of Science databases, applying social network visualization techniques. The co-authorship data used were extracted with the total counting method from a database containing 100,710 papers. Findings - Spanish inter-university collaboration patterns appear to be influenced by both geographic proximity and administrative and political affiliation. Inter-regional co-authorship encompasses regional sub-networks whose spatial scope conforms rather closely with Spanish geopolitical divisions. Papers involving international collaboration are written primarily with European Union and North and Latin American researchers. Greater visibility is attained with international co-authorship than with any other type of collaboration studied. Research limitations/implications - Impact was measured in terms of journals rather than each individual paper. The co-authorship data were taken from the Web of Knowledge and were not compared with data from other databases. Practical implications - The data obtained in the paper may provide guidance for public policy makers seeking to enhance and intensify the internationalization of scientific production in Spanish universities. Originality/value - The Spanish university system is in the midst of profound structural change. This is the first paper to describe Spanish university collaboration networks using social network visualization techniques, covering an area not previously addressed. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Internationalization of higher education is one of the new forms of engagements in higher education for ensuring sustainability. This study seeks to understand the research in higher education internationalization on publication outcomes, co-authorships between authors and similar countries, and co-occurrences of author keywords. This can provide valuable opportunities in expanding collaborative networks to impart global perspectives into teaching, learning, and research development. For this purpose, a bibliometric analysis was carried out to identify a total of 1412 journal articles from between 1974 to 2020 using information taken from the Scopus database. The research wraps up similarities on the growth of research, with the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, China and Canada emerging as among the countries that publish the most. There is a growing popularity of the term ‘higher education internationalization’ as part of the global new trends of cross-cultural study in transnational education.

Each country may choose to collaborate more closely with some countries than others, resulting in non-trivial structural patterns in international collaboration networks. While the structure of the collaboration networks among countries has been widely studied, the origin of such structure still lacks of systematic exploration. Analyzing bibliometric data from six disciplines, this paper reveals four categories of significant drivers for the collaboration closeness between countries, namely science, economy, geopolitics, and culture respectively. Countries with large and equivalent scientific sizes, as well as economic sizes, are more likely to collaborate closely with each other. In particular, comemberships in intergovernmental organizations largely promote close collaboration in science. Cultural links, including the shared language and religion, also facilitate close collaboration between countries.

The researchers examined the local and international collaborations that have a great impact on institutional performance. Design/methodology/approach: Collaboration dependence measure was used to investigate the impact of an institution on external information. Based on this information, the authors used “index of gain in impact through collaboration” to find the impact of collaborated publications in institutional research performance. Bibliographic data between 1996 and 2010 retrieved from Scopus were used to conduct current study. The authors carried out the case study of top institutes of Pakistan in terms of publication count to elaborate the difference between high performing institutions and those who gain disproportionally in terms of perceived quality of their output because of local or international collaboration. Findings: The results showed that the collaboration of developing countries institutes on international level had a great impact on institutional performance and they gain more benefit than local collaboration. Altogether, the scientific collaboration has a positive impact on institutional performance as measured by the cumulative source normalized impact per paper of their publications. The findings could also help researchers to find out appropriate collaboration partners. Originality/value: This study has revealed some salient characteristics of collaboration in academic research.

Prior to promoting scientific collaborations, it is crucial to understand what types of collaboration are more beneficial. By taking the stage of regional scientific development into consideration, this paper investigates the effect of various collaborations on regional scientific output. Our results highlight the differences between collaboration effects across regions at various capability levels. Scientifically weak regions benefit from more concentrated collaboration, in particular with advanced domestic regions. However, scientifically strong regions can benefit from a centrally located position in a broader collaboration network. Findings from this analysis indicate that international collaborations might not be beneficial a priori. Whether or not one region benefits from international collaborations depends on this region’s local capacity. Being embedded in a broad network structure can help increase one region’s publication output. However, such benefit is limited only to regions that have relatively higher research capacity. © 2019, The Author(s).",33

This study aimed to assess the bibliometric characteristics of public health related research articles published by researchers in African institutions from 1991 to 2005. Data used in this study were obtained from the online version of the ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded). Articles published between 1991 and 2005 that had the phrase 'public health' in the title, author keywords or abstract, and had at least one author whose contact address was in an African country, were selected for analysis. The annual number of public health related articles published by African researchers significantly increased from 28 articles in 1991 to 135 articles in 2005, a 382% increase. International collaboration also increased: from 45% of articles having international collaborators during 1991-1995, to 52% during1996-2000, and to 67% during 2001-2005. Collaborations were mostly with European and North American countries. Keywords, subject categories and collaboration patterns of articles varied across regions, reflecting differences in needs and collaboration networks. Public health related research output, as well as international collaborations, have been increasing in Africa. Regional variation observed in this study may assist policymakers to facilitate the advancement of public health research in different regions of Africa, and could be useful for international organisations in identifying needs and to allocate research funding. Future bibliometric analyses of articles published by African researchers, can consider conducting regional comparisons using standardised methods, as well as describing the overall patterns, in order to provide a more comprehensive view of their bibliometric characteristics. © 2011.

This study presents data generated from a comprehensive analysis of some 20,000 articles produced by 22 Nordic universities (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) in 1993. The results show that scientific collaboration plays a key role for all universities, and that they collaborate with external institutions in just about the same extent. The inter-Nordic university network comprises about ten percent of all institutional collaborations. However, the amount of collaboration varies across fields, physics and medicine having a high degree of collaboration. The inter-Nordic network is of equal importance as the national network in physics and geosciences. Especially, when one looks at international collaboration outside the Nordic arena, the number of overlapping partners is quite low. This suggests that research specialization is the major force governing international contacts.",33

Definitions, classifications and terminology remain open, reflecting that citizen science is an evolving phenomenon, a spectrum of practices whose classification may be useful but never unique or definitive. The aim of this article is to study citizen science publications in journals indexed by WoS, in particular how they have evolved in the last 20 years and the collaboration networks which have been created among the researchers in that time. In principle, the evolution can be analyzed, in a quantitative way, by the usual tools, such as the number of publications, authors, and impact factor of the papers, as well as the set of different research areas including citizen science as an object of study. But as citizen science is a transversal concept which appears in almost all scientific disciplines, this study becomes a multifaceted problem which is only partially modelled with the usual bibliometric magnitudes. It is necessary to consider new tools to parametrize a set of complementary properties. Thus, we address the study of the citizen science expansion and evolution in terms of the properties of the graphs which encode relations between scientists by studying co-authorship and the consequent networks of collaboration. This approach - not used until now in research on citizen science, as far as we know- allows us to analyze the properties of these networks through graph theory, and complement the existing quantitative research. The results obtained lead mainly to: (a) a better understanding of the current state of citizen science in the international academic system-by countries, by areas of knowledge, by interdisciplinary communities-as an increasingly legitimate expanding methodology, and (b) a greater knowledge of collaborative networks and their evolution, within and between research communities, which allows a certain margin of predictability as well as the definition of better cooperation strategies. © 2020, The Author(s).",32

The analytical approach adopted for this research takes the concept of scientific and technical human capital (STHC) as a starting point and seeks to explain the role and the extent to which collaboration networks can be utilized as a potential source for gaining access to flows of knowledge, that contribute to both building research careers and strengthening national innovation systems (NISs). The study is based on a combination of bibliometric analysis and interviews. The bibliometric analysis indicates that international scientific collaboration between the two countries has expanded rapidly, from just four co-authored papers in 1981 to 2,040 in 2010. The interviews suggest that a framework of exchange can be used as an approach to explain the underlying dynamics of collaboration. The findings suggest that augmenting the information base with qualitative data helps toward a more comprehensive understanding of science, technology and innovation (ST&I) dynamics.

Our aim is twofold: (1) Analyze the Brazilian scientific literature on LCA, forming a current view of how the LCA methodology is applied in the country; (2) within this view, trace the evolution of themes, characterize institution collaboration, and indicate major influences in Brazilian LCA community. Methods: Data were outlined around academic production and publications, from 1993 to 2015, indexed by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI- SCIE and SSCI) through a specific group of keywords. Initially, a temporal evolution and projection of papers, PhD and Master Theses, were performed. In sequence, indexed papers were analyzed through performance indicators (i.e., number of authors, impact factor, among others) and content evaluation (for instance, major addressed themes). Finally, a mapping of science was performed, with the aid of Cite Space software application, where coword (and evolution), cocollaboration (and evolution), and cocitation maps were created. Results and discussion: The survey identified 429 documents divided among international and national papers, PhD and Master Theses. From those documents, 165 were indexed. In terms of production and performance, the results indicate an undeniable evolution of the Brazilian LCA research, as affirmed by relations solidified through time. The main research field is “LCA application” with 84 % of papers, whereas “LCA methodology” completes the framework. In LCA applications, 25 % of publications are related to Biofuels—divided into bioethanol and biodiesel—which makes it the current dominant LCA research area in Brazil. The collaboration network demonstrates three main institution groups, whereas evolution through the years indicates that this situation may further improve. Influential authors are linked to LCA of biofuels, general LCA guidelines, and methodological LCA developments. Conclusions: Brazilian LCA research has been growing and more complex relations between themes and institutions denote that further developments can be expected. Cocollaboration indicates three main clusters, led by USP, Unicamp, and UFRJ. “Biofuels” is the main research area where sugarcane ethanol and biodiesel from different sources are the domain product systems. Cocitation analysis solidifies this statement, pointing to Isaias Macedo (and other biofuel researchers) as the main author in Brazilian LCA after ISO and Mark Goedkoop. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",31

It can not only bring lots of innovation to society, but may also cause some terrible consequences due to its unknown factors. International collaboration may be able to reduce risks, which means a lot to the exploration of the emerging technology. Taking dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as an example, this paper examines the rapid growth of Chinese DSSCs research and the rise of collaboration between China and other countries/region. We use bibliometric and social network analysis methods to explore the patterns of scientific collaboration at country, institution and individual levels using data from the Science Citation Index. Examining overall trends shows that China has increased her position in DSSCs around the world. Furthermore, by focusing on the individual level, we find that the most influential authors tend to have fixed co-author networks and author name order, which is something worth considering. We use co-author analysis software independently developed to check three kinds of fixed co-author networks to explore author contributions, influence, and Author Activity Index rank in collaboration networks and use the rank we calculated to further explain author contributions in the networks. Results show that Chinese-X (e.g., Chinese-American) authors have pushed the collaboration between country and country and almost every kind of small network has a top author in it to gather others together. The modified author activity index rank list may reflect real research level. Author collaboration patterns have been impacted by the kinds of their institutions to some degree. These results can undoubtedly promote the international collaboration and the innovation process in the similar emerging technology fields. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",29

In this study, we aimed to analyze the scientific research on OSA from 1991 to 2012 and to evaluate the collaboration networks between countries. Methods: We conducted a bibliometric study in the SCOPUS database. The systematic search was limited to “articles” published from 1991 to 2012. Articles are results of original research; we evaluated the following criteria: number of countries represented, number of authors, number of citations, and journal names. We determined which countries were the most productive (more articles published) and the number of collaborations between these countries. The probability of citation was evaluated using adjusted odds ratios in a logistic regression analysis. Results: We found a total of 6,896 OSA-related articles that had been published in 1,422 journals, 50 % of these articles were concentrated in 41 journals. Of the 74 different countries associated with these articles, the USA had the highest involvement with 23.8 % of all articles published. The probability of citation increased by 1.23 times for each additional author, and by 2.23 times for each additional country represented; these findings were independent of time since publication, journal, or the country of the author. Conclusions: Scientific production on OSA is increasing with limited international collaboration. The country with the greatest production in this period (1991–2012) was the USA, which concentrated the international collaboration network on OSA. We recommended that articles should be produced with international collaboration to improve the quantity of scientific publications and their chances of publication in high impact journals. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",29

The findings show that the number of social science articles published by Chinese authors in international journals has experienced a noticeable increase, and the collaboration networks of researchers from Mainland China have broadened, with the number of articles with a Chinese first author showing a strong upward trend. In addition, findings show that Chinese scholars are published in a wider range of journals, and there has been a steady increase in their appearance in higher impact journals (influenced in part by certain journals).

Leading contributors, research collaboration and theoretical underpinnings in both domestic-oriented and international-oriented research are discussed. The review comprises 508 articles published in domestic Chinese journals indexed by the Chinese Social Science Citation Index and 189 articles published in international journals indexed by the Social Science Citation Index between 2000 and 2011. Two bibliometric approaches, co-authorship analysis and co-citation analysis, were utilized. The results indicate that entrepreneurship research in China is characterized by a clear division, not only in terms of researchers in each community, collaborating network but also with regard to theoretical foundation. Domestic-oriented research is still in its infancy. The research community has attracted a majority of Chinese researchers who focus on inter-institutional collaboration based on mentorship and directing relationship. Scholars involved in international-oriented research engage in more open communication by collaborating not only with researchers from other Chinese institutions but also with those from foreign countries. At the same time, they contribute to the understanding of Chinese entrepreneurship by linking the entrepreneurship phenomenon in Chinese context to theoretical frameworks. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",28

As in other fields, rising international co-authorships reflect evolving international collaboration networks. We examine higher education research over two decades, applying automated bibliometric topic identification and social network analysis of 9067 papers in 13 core higher education journals (1998–2018). Remarkable expansion in the volume of papers and co-authorships has, surprisingly, not resulted in a more diverse network. Rather, existing co-authorship patterns are strengthened, with the dominance of scholars from a few Anglophone countries largely maintained. Researchers globally seek to co-author with leading scholars in these countries, especially the US, UK, and Australia—at least when publishing in the leading general higher education journals based there. Further, the two-mode social network analysis of countries and topics suggests that while Anglophone countries have led the development of higher education research, China and Germany, as leading research-producing countries, are increasingly influential within this world-spanning network. Topically, the vast majority of co-authored papers in higher education research focuses on individual-level phenomena, with organizational and system or country-level analysis constituting (much) smaller proportions, despite policymakers’ emphasis on cross-national comparisons and the growing importance of university actorhood. We discuss implications thereof for the future of the multidisciplinary field of higher education. © 2022, The Author(s).",27

An increasing number of related publications cause a crucial challenge to determine the relevant scientific output. Therefore, scientometric analyses are helpful to evaluate quantity as well as quality of the worldwide research activities on Rotavirus.Up to now, no in-depth global scientometric analysis relating to Rotavirus publications has been carried out. This study used scientometric tools and the method of density equalizing mapping to visualize the differences of the worldwide research effort referring to Rotavirus. The aim of the study was to compare scientific output geographically and over time by using an in-depth data analysis and New quality and quantity indices in science (NewQIS) tools. Furthermore, a gender analysis was part of the data interpretation. Methods: We retrieved all Rotavirus-related articles, which were published on ""Rotavirus"" during the time period from 1900 to 2013, from the Web of Science by a defined search term. These items were analyzed regarding quantitative and qualitative aspects, and visualized with the help of bibliometric methods and the technique of density equalizing mapping to show the differences of the worldwide research efforts. This work aimed to extend the current NewQIS platform. Results: The 5906 Rotavirus associated articles were published in 138 countries from 1900 to 2013. The USA authored 2037 articles that equaled 34.5% of all published items followed by Japan with 576 articles and the United Kingdom - as the most productive representative of the European countries - with 495 articles. Furthermore, the USA established the most cooperations with other countries and was found to be in the center of an international collaborative network. We performed a gender analysis of authors per country (threshold was set at a publishing output of more than 100 articles by more than 50 authors whose names could be identified in more than 50% of cases) showed a domination of female scientists in Brazil, while in all other countries, male scientists predominate. Relating the number of publications to the population of a country (Q1) and compared to the GPD (Q2), we found that European and African countries as well as Australia and New Zealand - not the USA - were among the top ranked nations. Conclusion: Regarding rotavirus-related scientific output, the USA was the overall leading nation when qualitative and qualitative aspects were taken into account. In contrast to these classical scientometric variables, indices such as Q1 and Q2 enable comparability between countries with unequal conditions and scientific infrastructures helping to differentiate publishing quality and quantity in a more relevant way. Also, it was deduced that counties with a high rotavirus-associated child mortality, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, should be integrated into the collaborative efforts more intensively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",25

Therefore, the objective of this research was to characterize the scientific production and extent where QGIS has been used as their main geospatial tool. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of documents published in Scopus from 2005 to 2020 (931 manuscripts). The annual rate of publications increase was 40.3%. We found strong and positive correlations regarding the number of contributing code programmers (r=0.66, p<0.005); and the total income of the QGIS project (r=0.88, p<0.001). Seventy-two percent of the publications were included in six fields of study, being Earth and Planetary Sciences the most representative. Italy was the country with larger scientific production, while the USA was the most influential country (being the first, regarding the number of citations). In terms of the countries, the larger number of papers found were from Portugal, Italy, Brazil, and France. The International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences-ISPRS Archives stands among journals with the largest number of publications (47). In terms of collaborative networks among countries, we found strong links between authors from Germany, Switzerland, Greece, and Spain.

It deals with Nepal considering its scientific output during 1966–2016 reflected as publications indexed in the Web of Science Database. Preliminary examination of the publication record for Nepal reveals a number of the following characteristics: (1) low volume, negligible growth and lack of distinct trend until 1989; (2) a marked growth followed by stagnation linked to political instability during the next 15 years; and (3) recovery and accelerated growth thereafter. Research publications during 2004–2013 increased thrice compared to 1994–2003, with expansion and shifts in disciplinary profile expressed in Essential Science Indicators 22 fields. Detailed bibliometric analysis of the 2004–2013 publications (3011 articles and reviews) from Nepal suggests the citation impact of about the world average, but very high (76%) average international co-authorship. The disciplinary profile is diverse judging from seven most productive fields (clinical medicine, plant and animal science, environment/ecology, geosciences, agricultural sciences, and chemistry) with 4–40% national disciplinary share. Clinical medicine, geosciences and agricultural sciences exhibit relatively high impact. Fields with the smaller share (< 3%), such as molecular biology and genetics, economics and business, psychiatry and psychology, materials science, and biology and biochemistry, exhibit citation impact distinctly higher than the world average. Publications from Nepal show the presence of a vast international collaborative network that is dominated by authors affiliated to institutions in the USA, India, UK, Japan, South Korea and Germany. Based on the analysis of the disciplinary diversity and the national versus global relative disciplinary shares, Nepal’s publication profile is inferred to be a hybrid of the ‘bio-environmental’ and ‘western’ models. Concerning the state of the development of science and technology in Nepal during 2004–2013, the high dependence on international collaboration in the internationally visible publications in most of the bio-environmental, physico-chemical and engineering fields points to basically a ‘building-up stage’. In clinical medicine (with a large share of public health) and geosciences, however, Nepal has demonstrated research strengths evident from the high citation impact in these fields. Moreover, the available data suggest that significant advances were made in higher education sector in both fields during the last 25 years. Despite the notable negative effect of the prolonged domestic armed political conflict on the research activities and acquisition of new data in the field-based sciences, the post-conflict period shows signs of recovery in both domestic and international collaborations leading to again an accelerated growth in scientific publications. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",24

Methods: The present study has identified publications on leishmaniasis in the Medline database from 1945 to 2010, analyzing them according to bibliometric indicators and statistics from social network analysis. Examining aspects such as scientific production, diachronic evolution, and collaboration and configuration of the research groups in the field, we have considered the different types of Leishmania studied and the institutional affiliation and nationality of the authors. Results: Seven-hundred and thirty-five authors participate in 154 prominent research clusters or groups. Although the most predominant and consolidated collaborations are characterized by members from the same country studying the same type of Leishmania, there are also notable links between authors from different countries or who study different clinical strains of the disease. Brazil took the lead in this research, with numerous Brazilian researchers heading different clusters in the center of the collaboration network. Investigators from the USA, India, and European countries, such as France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy, also stand out within the network.

The source of the data used was the multidisciplinary database Scopus. To perform this comparison, ALIS’ production was analyzed in order to identify authorship patterns; for example, authors’ countries of residence, co-authorship trends, and collaboration networks. Research topics were identified through keyword analysis, while performance was measured by examining the number of citations articles received. This study provides substantial information. The research lines detected through examining the keywords in ALIS articles were determined to be similar to those for the top LIS journals in both Asia and worldwide. Specifically, ALIS authors are focusing on metrics, bibliometrics, and social networking, which follows global trends.

However, the uptake of PCM systems has been limited due to their relatively slow charging response, limited life, and economic considerations. Fortunately, a concerted global research effort is now underway to remove these remaining technical challenges. The bibliometric analysis of this review reveals that a major focus is now on the development of nano-enhanced phase change materials (NePCM), which have the potential to mitigate many of these technical challenges for PCM-based thermal energy storage systems. As such, our bibliometric analysis has zeroed in on research in the field of thermal energy storage using NePCMs since 1977. It was found that journal articles were the most frequently used document type, representing 79% of the records and that the pace of new work in this specific area has increased exponentially over these two decades, with China accounting for the highest number of citations and the most publications (168), followed by India and Iran.

We combine bibliometric network analysis with difference-in-difference program evaluation, statistical matching techniques, and system architecture analysis to evaluate complex research partnerships more adequately ‘in their own terms.’ We apply our method to one national “flagship” policy initiative − the MIT Portugal Program − where we compare program participants to a carefully assembled peer group of non-participant Portuguese researchers to assess the impact of MIT-Portugal with regard to idiosyncratic, more structurally oriented, and arguably less conventional program goals. As part of this methodological approach, we propose difference-in-differences Content Overlay Maps (“maps of science”) as a means to evaluate how program participants change their research focus over time relative to their national peers. These findings are complemented by an analysis of the collaborative network of participants and their institutions, as well as more traditional forms of impact assessment. Our findings indicate that complex international capacity-building partnerships can have a significant impact on the ‘hosting’ country in terms of cluster formation and research re-orientation. Moreover, they suggest that our mixed-method approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating complex capacity-building initiatives in ways that do justice to their one-of-a-kind architectures and goals. Future research should aim to study more closely the relationship between different program architectures and program impacts, and combine our largely quantitative approach with ongoing qualitative and interpretive policy analysis. © 2016",20

Since that time, it has evolved from an emerging research area to a relatively mature field with regular regional and international conferences and key journals publishing main theoretical developments and empirical explorations in the field. This descriptive bibliometric study examines the state and development of international research on gifted education using publication and citation data from four specialized journals in the field between 1957 and 2017. The study reveals the dynamics of publication and citation on gifted education research over time, as well as the distribution of articles across the four journals. The analysis also provides an idea of the countries/regions and institutions leading the research on gifted education and information about the most productive authors, as well as the most influential articles over the last 60 years. In addition, the study uncovers the snapshot of collaboration networks between countries/regions, institutions, and individual researchers.

It draws on computer science, engineering, psychology, physiology, and neuroscience to computationally model, track, and classify human emotions and affective states. While the US once dominated the field in terms of research and citation from 1995–2015, China is now emerging as a global contender in research output, claiming second place for the most cited country from 2016–2020. This article maps the rhizomatic growth and development of scientific publications devoted to emotion-sensing AI technologies. It employs a bibliometric analysis that identifies major national contributors and international alliances in the field over the past 25 years. Contrary to the ongoing political rhetoric of a new Cold War, we argue that there are in fact vibrant AI research alliances and ongoing collaborations between the West and China, especially with the US, despite competing interests and ethical concerns. Our observations of historical data indicate two major collaborative networks: the “US/Asia-Pacific cluster” consisting of the US, China, Singapore, Japan and the “European” cluster of Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. Our analysis also uncovers a major shift in the focus of affective computing research away from diagnosis and detection of mental illnesses to more commercially viable applications in smart city design.

There is an increasing interest on the topic reflected by the number of annually published items. It is therefore difficult for a single scientist to survey all published items and to gauge their scientific importance or value. Thus, tremendous efforts were made to establish sustainable parameters to evaluate scientific work within the past decades. It was the birth of scientometrics. Materials and Methods To quantify the global research activity in this field, a scientometric analysis was conducted. We analyzed the research output of countries, individual institutions, authors, and their collaborative networks by using the Web of Science database. Density-equalizing maps and network diagrams were employed as state of the art visualization techniques. Results The United States is the leading country in terms of published items (n = 685), institutions (n = 347), and cooperation (n = 112). However, although there is dominance in quantity, the most intensive international networks between authors and institutions are not linked to the United States. By contrast, most of the European countries combine the highest impact of publications. Further analysis reveal the influence of international cooperation and associated phenomena on the research field HD. Conclusion We conclude that the field of HD is constantly progressing. The importance of international cooperation in the scientific community is continuously growing. © Georg Thieme Verlag KGStuttgart · New York.",18

However, the productivity and biodiversity of freshwater bodies are undergoing dramatic degradation as a result of climate- and anthropogenic-induced changes worldwide. Despite a well-documented literature on freshwater biodiversity, we still lack a comprehensive and objective overview of biodiversity research conducted in different types of freshwater bodies. Here, we conducted a comparative study of freshwater biodiversity in different ecosystem types at the global scale to describe the current state of knowledge, map the scientific geographical distribution and international collaboration network and identify persistent and emerging themes. Thus, metadata of biodiversity studies carried out in six freshwater ecosystem types - river, lake, wetland, stream, reservoir and pond- were extracted from SCI-E and SSCI databases of the Web of Science and then visualized for science mapping using bibliometric analysis. Our findings showed that in the field of freshwater biodiversity (i) the number of publications in various freshwater habitats has risen considerably over the last two decades with the highest average annual growth rate in river- and lake-related studies, (ii) there was a clear bias in the geographical distribution of the research with fewer scientific production and international collaboration in less developed parts of the world. The USA (20%) and China (19%) are the main leading countries and Europe (30%), Asia (26%, mainly China and India) and North America (24%) are major continents contributing to this field, (iii) taxonomic groups have been investigated disproportionally among different freshwater habitats, (iv) habitat heterogeneity and fragmentation, land use change, climate change, eutrophication and invasive species are the most frequent driving factors, (v) the persistent and emerging themes differ among water ecosystems, e.g. disproportionate assessment of biodiversity measures. Furthermore, functional and phylogenetic facets in this area are poorly understood. Overall, clear obtained distinctions in the hotspots and thematic areas of different freshwater environments can contribute to identify the missing pieces in current research, and put an effort to investigate the non-explored or under-explored areas of research. © 2021 The Author(s)",18

Despite the large number of available reviews on this topic, a bibliometric tool-based meta-analysis is missing in the literature. Scope and approach: To evaluate the influence and significance of the countries, journals, organizations and authors that have contributed the most to this topic, the popular bibliometric markers, including article count, citation count, and Hirsch index (H-index), are taken into account. Their collaborative networks and keyword co-occurrence along with the trend analysis are also sketched out using the VOSviewer software. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bibliometric review on the topic and hence it is envisaged that it will attract researchers to explore future research dimensions in the related field. Key findings and conclusions: India provided the most articles, making up more than 27.49 percent of the entire corpus. The International Journal of Biological Macromolecules published the most articles (44), and it also received the most citations (2012). The Journal of Ethnopharmacology (28 articles) and Current Pharmaceutical Design (20 articles) were the next most prolific journals with 1231 and 812 citations, respectively. The results indicate a significant increase in both research and publications on the wound-healing properties of curcumin. Recent studies have concentrated on creating novel medicine-delivery systems that use nano-curcumin to boost the effect of the curcumin molecule in therapeutic targeting. It has also been observed that genetic engineering and biotechnology have recently been employed to address the commercial implications of curcumin. © 2023 by the authors.",17

Furthermore, our research is of great benefit to better understanding of the interplay of knowledge and collaboration networks on knowledge creation. The empirical results confirm that the prolific co-authorship and international co-authorship have positive and significant effects on the knowledge creation. The results from the 3SLS estimation models using the number of publications and citations as dependent variables also show that the structural holes of an author in the collaboration networks and her/his knowledge elements in knowledge networks have positive effects on her/his knowledge creation. These findings suggest that structural capital of an author and his/her knowledge elements are important influence factors of the quantity and quality of research output. The results of the models in this paper suggest that authors with better performance in knowledge creation are more likely to attract collaborators and occupy structural holes.

Driven by the need to assess the contribution and effectiveness of these networks in informing S&T management, we explored the evolution and dynamics of tuberculosis scientific networks involving the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), the major public health S&T Institution in Brazil. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to produce a 10-year (2005–2009, 2010–2014) retrospective longitudinal mapping of Brazilian tuberculosis research networks within the country and internationally, highlighting Fiocruz collaborations. Co-authorship analysis showed a significant expansion of collaboration in Brazil and the role of Fiocruz and other leading national institutions in maintaining connectivity, facilitating knowledge exchange and reducing network vulnerability. It also identified influential researchers that can act as information leaders and support strategic decisions. When we focused on networks inside the institution, the analysis showed a clear discontinuation between the clinical and the public health research areas, which needs specific internal policies to improve collaborations since outcomes in TB are expected to provide better diagnostic tools and more effective treatments. The approach provides evidence to support S&T management by pinpointing: key central institutions maintaining network connectivity; most influential researchers that can act as advisors/ experts for investment and induction policies; key Fiocruz researchers that could improve information exchange, systems integration and innovation within the institution; opportunities for synergy between internal research groups working in complementary areas. In summary, we observed that SNA parameters proved to be a valuable tool that, along with other indicators, can strengthen knowledge platforms to support S&T management efforts. © 2017 Fonseca et al.

Methods: Using the Scopus database, we identified all original research articles on schistosomiasis from 1908 to 2020 from SEA countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Bibliographic and citation information was obtained, and visualization of collaboration networks of countries and keywords related to schistosomiasis was conducted using VOSviewer software. Results: We obtained 528 schistosomiasis articles published between 1908 and 2020 from SEA countries. The number of publications continued to increase and peaked from 2000 until 2020. The Philippines had the highest number of publications (n = 231), followed by Thailand (n = 153), and Malaysia (n = 64). The leading journals with the highest number of publications in this field include the Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health (n = 96), Acta Tropica (n = 27), and Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases (n = 24). The most common keywords related to schistosomiasis research in SEA were ""schistosomiasis"", ""Schistosoma japonicum"", “Schistosoma mekongi”, “Schistosoma mansoni”, and “praziquantel”. International collaboration was significantly correlated with scientific productivity for schistosomiasis research. Conclusion: Our study showed the research landscape, trends and development, and collaboration among researchers in schistosomiasis in SEA. Our results also revealed the limited schistosomiasis research in several SEA countries.

In recent years, international cooperation has been considered to be one of the key factors promoting the sustainable development of entrepreneurial research. However, the evolution of the cooperative network of entrepreneurial research and the relationship between international cooperation and entrepreneurial research performance has not received the attention of most researchers. Therefore, we used a multilevel collaborative analysis method, i.e., country, city, institution and scholar, analyzing 2037 studies in this area from 2009 to 2018 from the Business Source Complete database by collaboration network analysis and bibliometric analysis. Our study tracked the evolution and cooperation trends in entrepreneurship research and detailed characteristics of international academic cooperation over the past decade, and we found the following: (1) The four types of cooperative networks have evolved over time, and generally conform to the distribution characteristics of the core periphery; cities, institutions, and researchers from central countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany occupy central positions in cooperation; they are scale-free networks and subject to the principle of priority connection. (2) The evolution of cooperative networks at different levels are non-conformal, there is a subtle relationship between micro-networks that can explain the distribution and changes in macro-networks. (3) International academic cooperation can promote the performance of entrepreneurial research, and cooperation has become the main theme of entrepreneurial research. These findings can help researchers to better study cooperative relationships in entrepreneurship research. Moreover, they can provide entrepreneurial decision support for national and local governments and contribute to the sustainable development of entrepreneurial research. © 2019 by the authors.",16

Furthermore, the primary and promising treatment technologies for microcystin pollution were also summarized and discussed. The results indicated an urgent practical demand to remediate microcystin pollution according to the increasing number of publications since 2005. China had the highest number of publications, whereas the United States was the core country in the international collaboration network. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and University of Cincinnati showed their leading positions considering article amounts and academic cooperation. Dionysiou DD contributed the most articles, and Carmichael WW had the highest number of co-citations. Three treatment technologies, including biodegradation, chemical oxidation and adsorption, were the major strategies to remediate the pollution of microcystins in water. In addition, the toxicity of toxins/their metabolites, degradation kinetics, and elimination mechanism were also important research contents. Bacterial degradation, photocatalytic degradation, and multiple-technologies approach have been identified with great potential and should be given more attention in future studies.

Here, we use co-authorship ego networks to quantify collaboration behaviour and career progression of a cohort of contributors to biennial International Society of Behavioral Ecology meetings (1992, 1994, 1996). Among this cohort, women were slower and less likely to become a principal investigator (PI; approximated by having at least three last-author publications) and published fewer papers over fewer years (i.e. had shorter academic careers) than men. After adjusting for publication number, women also had fewer collaborators (lower adjusted network size) and published fewer times with each co-author (lower adjusted tie strength), albeit more often with the same group of collaborators (higher adjusted clustering coefficient). Authors with stronger networks were more likely to become a PI, and those with less clustered networks did so more quickly. Women, however, showed a stronger positive relationship with adjusted network size (increased career length) and adjusted tie strength (increased likelihood to become a PI).

We selected 38,224 papers in the field of AI from 1985 to 2019 in the core collection database of Web of Science (WoS) and studied international collaboration from the perspectives of authors, institutions, and countries through bibliometric analysis and social network analysis. The bibliometric results show that in the field of AI, the number of published papers is increasing every year, and 84.8% of them are cooperative papers. Collaboration with more than three authors, collaboration between two countries and collaboration within institutions are the three main levels of collaboration patterns. Through social network analysis, this study found that the US, the UK, France, and Spain led global collaboration research in the field of AI at the country level, while Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates had a high degree of international participation. Collaboration at the institution level reflects obvious regional and economic characteristics. There are the Developing Countries Institution Collaboration Group led by Iran, China, and Vietnam, as well as the Developed Countries Institution Collaboration Group led by the US, Canada, the UK. Also, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (China) plays an important, pivotal role in connecting the these institutional collaboration groups. First, participant contributions in international collaboration may have varied, but in our research they are viewed equally when building collaboration networks. Second, although the edge weight in the collaboration network is considered, it is only used to help reduce the network and does not reflect the strength of collaboration. The findings fill the current shortage of research on international collaboration in AI. They will help inform scientists and policy makers about the future of AI research. This work is the longest to date regarding international collaboration in the field of AI. This research explores the evolution, future trends, and major collaboration patterns of international collaboration in the field of AI over the past 35 years. It also reveals the leading countries, core groups, and characteristics of collaboration in the field of AI.  © 2020 2020 Haotian Hu et al., published by Sciendo.",14

In parallel with the geographical distribution of FMF, the prevalence is notably higher in some population groups including Turks, Jews, Armenians and Arabs. The aim of this study was to assess FMF articles published between 2010 and 2019 bibliometrically and to present up-to-date data. This bibliometric research was conducted on the Scopus database. The key term ''familial Mediterranean fever'' was utilized to generate the publication list. The number of articles, active countries journals, prolific authors and citation data were determined. Visualization maps that revealed collaboration networks were also created. The number of FMF articles displayed a stable trend between 2010 and 2019 (p > 0.05). The top five countries according to the number of articles were Turkey (n = 473; 52.90%), Israel (n = 86; 9.61%), Japan (n = 39; 4.36%), Italy (n = 38; 4.25%) and the USA (n = 37; 4.13%. Italy, the USA and France were ranked as the top three countries for the average number of citations per article. Rheumatology International, Clinical Rheumatology, Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology, Annals of Rheumatic Diseases and Pediatric Rheumatology were the top five journals according to the number of FMF articles. The geographical distribution of FMF was seen to affect the article production of countries. Although Turkey dominated the field in the number of articles, it was not at the forefront in the average number of citations. To increase the production of articles in the field of FMF, it is necessary to support researchers in countries other than those which are already strongly active. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",12

The findings support our theoretical hypotheses that an institution's research resources are positively related to its central position in the network. Astronomical institutions with superior resources, such as being equipped with international observational facilities and having substantial research manpower, tend to have more foreign partners (high degree centrality) and play an influential role (high betweenness centrality) in the international collaboration network. An institution becomes more and more active in international collaborations as its research population expands. In terms of the relationship, which is captured by an actor institution's co-authorship preference for each partner in the network, the effect of research resources is not as significant as expected. We found that astronomical institutions are not necessarily preferentially co-authoring with partners that have better research resources. In addition, this study indicates that geographic closeness (or “geographic proximity”) largely affects the occurrence of international collaboration. The investigated institutions apparently prefer partners from neighboring countries. This finding gives an indication of the phenomenon of “regional homophily” in the international collaboration network. © 2015 ASIS&T",12

A total of 1878 international collaboration papers of the influenza virus vaccine field published from 2006 to 2013 were collected from theWeb of Science database. Based on this dataset, the paper utilizes bibliometrics and social network analysis approaches to explore international publication trends and collaboration performance in the influenza virus vaccine field. Results show that: (1) the three kinds of collaboration networks (country, city and institution levels) all present dynamic structures, strong core-periphery characteristics, and their degree centrality distributions follows segmented Zifp-Pareto distribution; and (2) although it is known that there exist corresponding relationships among countries, cities and institutions in the geographical position, most of their associated categories, network locations and changing trends are all non-conformal.

However, the previous studies only discuss a particular aspect or characteristic of DCM, the current state and trends were explored by limited research. We aimed to perform a systemically bibliometric study of DCM research progress status in the past decade, visualize the internal conceptual structure and potential associations, and further explore the prospective study trends. Methods: Articles related to DCM published from January 2012 to December 2021 were collected in the Web of Science core collection (WoSCC) database on June 24, 2022. We exported all bibliographic records, including titles, abstracts, keywords, authorship, institutions, addresses, publishing sources, references, citation times, and year of publication. In addition, the journal Impact Factor and Hirsch index were obtained from the Journal Citation Report. We conducted the data screening, statistical analysis, and visualization via the Bibliometrix R package. VOS viewer software was employed to generate the collaboration network map among countries and institutions for better performance in visualization. Results: In total, 1,887 original research articles from 2012 to 2021 were identified. The number of annual publications rapidly increased from 107 to 278, and a drastic increase in citation times was observed in 2017–2019. As for global contributions, the United States was the most influential country with the highest international collaboration, while China was the most productive country. Professor Cai Lu was the most prolific author. Shandong University published the most articles. Cardiovascular Diabetology journal released the most DCM-related articles. “Metabolic Stress-induced Activation of FoxO1 Triggers Diabetic Cardiomyopathy in Mice” Battiprolu PK et al., J Clin Invest, 2012. was the most top-cited article regarding local citations. The top three keywords in terms of frequency were apoptosis, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. The analysis of future topic trends indicated that “Forkhead box protein O1,” “Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction,” “Dapagliflozin,” “Thioredoxin,” “Mitochondria dysfunction,” “Glucose,” “Pyroptosis,” “Cardiac fibroblast” and “Long non-coding RNA” could be promising hotspots. Conclusion: This study provides meaningful insights into DCM, which is expected to assist cardiologists and endocrinologists in exploring frontiers and future research directions in the domain through a refined and concise summary.

The high biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest (AF) and its severe degradation turned it into a “restoration hotspot.” We performed a bibliometric analysis of the research on restoration of the Brazilian AF to identify thematic trends, potential gaps, as well as networks and benefits of collaboration. We also explored the spatial distribution of degradation, restoration science, and practice within the AF. We analyzed 932 articles on the issue from the Web of Science platform (1990–2020). Publications abruptly increased in the last 15 years, first by Brazilian groups and later in collaboration with foreign groups. International collaboration increased the probability of highly cited articles. Topics addressed have changed greatly in their relative position over time, likely due to scientific advances refuting theories or invalidating failed techniques. Natural regeneration was the main trending topic, while forest succession was the main emerging topic, and ecosystem services appeared as a trending topic. Research and restoration initiatives were both unevenly distributed throughout the AF region, with the southeastern region of Brazil standing out (60% of publications). The percentage of the original AF undergoing restoration is very low in all regions, regardless of scientific publications or AF extent remaining. The knowledge gaps pointed—climate change and functional traits—should drive priorities for research funding, aiming to provide robust evidence to support decision-making processes as well as restoration practices. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.",11

The emergency situation demanded speed and collective effort by researchers worldwide, and Science was quick to investigate the disease and publish the results. Scientific knowledge was created and disseminated through collaboration in this process. Publications are still the best way of disseminating scientific knowledge. They allow to record progress in a field of studies and observe how scientists collaborate to produce advances as new knowledge and technologies are generated. An effective way to map such advances is to analyze scientists' Social Networks (relationship and collaboration networks), since collaboration is currently an intrinsic characteristic of modern science. Co-authorship of publications is thus an important indicator of scientific collaboration for understanding progress in various areas of Science. The current study aimed to use a generalizable method for mapping and analyzing the Scientific Social Network formed in the domain of Zika, demonstrating how scientists collaborated to produce the main research results, identifying the leading research groups on Zika and the most influential researchers. Social Network Analysis was applied to the co-authorship networks formed from 2015 to 2016. The study showed that a Zika researcher's influence is basically determined by three factors: (a) number of publications; (b) diversified partnerships; and (c) the links established with the research area's pioneers. © 2019 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Nevertheless, the literature reveals a lack of thorough understanding of optimal SNA applications in this field. Therefore, this paper aims to convey a comprehensive critical review of past applications of SNA in this field. Design/methodology/approach: 95 relevant journal papers were initially identified from the “Web of Science” database and a bibliometric analysis was carried out using the “VOS Viewer” software. The subsequent in-depth review of the SNA methods, focussed on 24 specifically relevant papers selected from these aforesaid 95 papers. Findings: A significant growth of publications in this field was identified after 2014, especially related to topics on stakeholder management. “Journal of Cleaner Production”, “International Journal of Project Management” and “Sustainability” were identified as the most productive sources in this field, with the majority of publications from China. Interviews and questionnaires were the popular data collection methods while SNA “Centrality” measures were utilised in over 70% of the studies. Furthermore, potential areas were noted, to improve the mapping and thereby provide useful information to managers who could influence relevant networks and consequentially better sustainability outcomes, including those enhanced by collaborative networks. Originality/value: Closer collaboration has been found to help enhance sustainability in construction and built environment, hence attracting research interest amongst scholars on how best to enable this. SNA is established as a significant methodological approach to analysing interrelationships and collaborative potential in general. In a pioneering application here, this paper initiates the drawing together of findings from relevant literature to provide useful insights for future researchers to comprehensively identify, compare and contrast the applications of SNA techniques in construction and built environment management from a sustainability viewpoint. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",11

To conduct research and tackle existing healthcare disparities, RSV-related research activities around the globe need to be described. Hence, we assessed the associated scientific output (represented by research articles) by geographical, chronological and socioeconomic criteria and analysed the authors publishing in the field by gender. Also, the 15 most cited articles and the most prolific journals were identified for RSV research. Design Retrospective, descriptive study. Setting The NewQIS (New Quality and Quantity Indices in Science) platform was employed to identify RSV-related articles published in the Web of Science until 2013. We performed a numerical analysis of all articles, and examined citation-based aspects (eg, citation rates); results were visualised by density equalising mapping tools. Results We identified 4600 RSV-related articles. The USA led the field; US-American authors published 2139 articles (46.5%% of all identified articles), which have been cited 83 000 times. When output was related to socioeconomic benchmarks such as gross domestic product or Research and Development expenditures, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia and Chile were ranked in leading positions. A total of 614 articles on RSV (13.34% of all articles) were attributed to scientific collaborations. These were primarily established between high-income countries. The gender analysis indicated that male scientists dominated in all countries except Brazil. Conclusions The majority of RSV-related research articles originated from high-income countries whereas developing nations showed only minimal publication productivity and were barely part of any collaborative networks. Hence, research capacity in these nations should be increased in order to assist in addressing inequities in resource allocation and the clinical burden of RSV in these countries. © 2017 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

Currently known transmissible cancers traverse terrestrial and marine environments, and are predicted to be more widely distributed across animal groups; thus, the implementation of effective collaborative scientific networks is important for combating existing and emerging forms. Here, we quantify how collaborative effort on the three known transmissible cancers has advanced through the formation of collaborative networks among institutions and disciplines. These three cancers occur in bivalves (invertebrates—disseminated neoplasia; DN), Tasmanian devils (vertebrate—marsupial; devil facial tumour disease; DFTD) and dogs (vertebrate—eutherian mammal; canine transmissible venereal tumour; CTVT). Research on CTVT and DN has been conducted since 1876 and 1969, respectively, whereas systematic research on DFTD only started in 2006. Yet, collaborative effort on all three diseases is global, encompassing six major Scopus subject areas. Collaborations steadily increased between 1963 and 2006 for CTVT and DN, with similar acceleration for all three cancers since 2006. Network analyses demonstrated that scientists are organizing themselves into efficient collaborative networks; however, these networks appear to be far stronger for DFTD and DN, possibly due to the recent detection of new strains adding impetus to research and associated publications (enhancing citation trajectories). In particular, global and multidisciplinary collaborations formed almost immediately after DFTD research was initiated, leading to similar research effort and relatively greater research outputs compared to the other two diseases. Therefore, in the event of outbreaks of new lineages of existing transmissible cancers, or the discovery of new transmissible cancers in the future, the rapid formation of international collaborations spanning relevant disciplines is vital for the efficient management of these diseases. © 2020 The Authors.

Scientific collaboration is vital for to the advance of knowledge and is especially important in health sciences. The aim of this study is to identify scientific collaboration indicators and co-authorship networks of researchers and Spanish institutions that publish on multiple sclerosis (MS) during the period 1996-2010. Materials and methods. The analyzed papers were obtained from Web of Science and Scopus international databases, and IBECS and IME national databases, applying specific search profiles in each one of them. In order to identify collaboration networks all signed papers were quantified and co-authored measures were obtained, as the different indexes, degree, intermediation and closeness. Results. 1,613 articles were published in the period 1996-2010, 92% of them in collaboration. With 10 or more works signed in collaboration, 20 Spanish research groups in MS were identified. 64.23% of the papers were published in collaboration between Spanish institutions, and 33.85% were in collaboration with foreign institutions. The institutional participation analysis has identified a large network of institutional partnerships that integrates 27 institutions, with the Hospital Vall d'Hebron in a central position. International collaboration is headed by the U.S. and European countries, most notably the UK and Italy. Conclusion. The most collaborative authors, institutions, and work groups in Spanish research in MS have been identified. Despite these indicators that characterize the collaboration in this area, it is necessary to enhance cooperation between them, since this collaboration is positively related to the quality and impact of research and publications.",9

Methods: Global mortality and disease data were used to summarize the burden of mortality, disease, risk factor and patterns of inequalities in the region. Medline bibliometrics were used to estimate epidemiological publication output by country. Key informant surveys, Internet and literature searches and author knowledge and networks were used to elicit perspectives on epidemiological training, research, funding and workforce. Findings: The WPR has the lowest age-standardized disability-adjusted lifeyears (DALY) rate per 1000 of the six WHO regions, with non-communicable disease making the largest percentage contributions in both low- and middle-income countries (LMICs, 68%) and high-income countries (HICs, 84%) in the WPR. The number of Medline-indexed epidemiological research publications per year was greatest for Japan, Australia and China. However, the rate per head of population was greatest for Micronesia and New Zealand. The substantive focus of research roughly equated with burden of disease patterns. Research capacity (staff, funding, infrastructure) varies hugely between countries. Epidemiology training embedded within academic Masters of Public Health programmes is the dominant vehicle for training in most countries. Field epidemiology and in-service training are also common. The Pacific Island countries and territories, because of sparse populations over large distances and chronic workforce and funding capacity problems, rely on outside agencies (e.g. WHO, universities) for provision of training. Cross-national networks and collaborations are increasing. Conclusion: Communicable disease surveillance and research need consolidation (especially in eastern Asian WPR countries), and noncommunicable disease epidemiological capacity requires strengthening to match disease trends. Capacity and sustainability of both training and research within LMICs in WPR are ongoing priorities. China in particular is advancing quickly. One role for the IEA in building capacity is facilitating collaborative networks within WPR.

To comprehensively understand the research situation and development trend of adaptive water management, this study conducts a systematic literature review of articles published in International Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) journals based on bibliometric analysis. The results show that adaptive water governance as an emerging topic of water governance has an overall growth trend in published articles. The articles on adaptive water governance mainly concentrated on the disciplines of environmental science and environmental studies. Developed countries are a hub for water governance research, and China has the sixth largest number of articles from around the world. The adaptive water governance research has formed a preliminary global collaborative network, but the authors’ collaboration needs to be strengthened. The most popular topics of adaptive water governance include South Africa, adaptive management, groundwater, principal component analysis, scenario planning, the analytic hierarchy process, resources, basins, computer experiments, and technology development.

This study is an attempt to comprehend whether a global emergency of COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on researcher international collaboration. The authors analyze the research collaboration before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how scientists collaborated within their own nation's borders and beyond. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze the research collaboration before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how scientists collaborated within their own nation's borders and beyond. The authors collected a dataset of research publications published in journals in the research area of business and economics and indexed in the WoS Core Collection database by researchers from 11 countries (Austria, Denmark, Greece, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Korea (South), Mexico, Pakistan, Romania and Vietnam). In total, 14,824 publication records were considered for the literature analysis. This study presented the scientometric analysis of these publications using bibliometric, statistical, factor analysis and network analysis methods. The results are evaluated and interpreted in the context of the Hofstede's model of cultural dimensions. The results of this study provide evidence to research management to properly allocate their efforts to improve the researcher cooperation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and to overcome its negative outcomes in the years to come. Findings: The results of our study show that uncertainty avoidance as the cultural factor defined by the Hofstede's model has significantly influenced the properties of research collaboration networks in the domain of business and economics. Uncertainty avoidance focuses on how cultures adapt to changes and cope with uncertainty, while the global COVID-19 pandemic introduced a lot of change and uncertainty all levels of society around the world. Research limitations/implications: The study exclusively examines 14,824 research outputs which have been indexed in the WoS Core Collection database from 2019 till 15 November 2020 and only covered one research area (business economics). Thus, documents published in any other different channels and sources which are not covered in WoS are excluded from this study. The authors have analyzed the publications from just 11 countries, which represent a small part of the global research output. Also, the Hofstede’s cultural dimensions model is not a unique way to study cultural characteristics at the national level. Practical implications: The results of this study will provide evidence to research management to properly allocate their efforts to improve the researcher cooperation during the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and to overcome its negative outcomes in the years to come. Originality/value: Considering the global impact and social distress due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, this study is significant in the present scenario for identifying the changes in the characteristics of research collaboration networks of 11 diverse (in terms of geographical distribution and cultural differences in terms of the Hofstede’s cultural dimensions model) countries between 2019 (the year before COVID-19) and 2020 (the year of COVID-19), which has not been done before. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",8

Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, research on tourism resilience can be divided into two stages. Climate change and the pandemic are the two major factors affecting tourism resilience at destination, organizational, and individual levels. Additionally, we identified five major themes of tourism resilience research. Finally, we provide three suggestions for rebuilding a new paradigm of tourism development in the post-pandemic era.

This study aimed to evaluate the trends and characteristics of PCOS publications in Southeast Asia (SEA) through a bibliometric analysis. Methods: Systematic review of literature on PCOS in SEA countries between 1975 and 2020 was performed using the Scopus database. All published studies on PCOS conducted in or published by authors from any of the countries in SEA were included in this analysis. Bibliographic information was obtained, and visualization of collaboration networks of countries and keywords was conducted using VOSviewer software. Results: A total of 260 articles were included in this analysis. The number of PCOS publications in SEA continued to increase through the years. The country with the highest number of publications was Thailand while Singapore produced the most publications with the greatest impact. The focus of research in SEA was on PCOS prevalence, risk factors, infertility, and metabolic complications. A country's fertility rate, research and development expenditures (%GDP), number of researchers per million people, and international research collaborations significantly correlated with PCOS research impact in SEA. Conclusion: This is the first bibliometric analysis in PCOS research in SEA. Despite the continuing increase in PCOS publications in SEA, it still lags compared to other regions. Countries in SEA should consider policies and strategies directed at increasing research support and encouraging international collaborations for local researchers to produce more meaningful publications and augment PCOS knowledge in the region. © 2022",8

To date, there has been no study investigating evolution of this area in this region. The aim of this study was to evaluate for first time, the historical evolution of cancer genomics research in Latin America. Methods: Bibliometric cross-sectional study of documents on cancer genomics published by Latin American authors until 2023 in Scopus was performed. Statistical and visual analysis was performed with R programming language. Results: A total of 1534 documents were obtained. The first document of cancer genomics research was published in 1997, marking the inception of a 26-year evaluation period that extended until 2023. Among the documents, 74.3% (n = 1140) constituted original articles, followed by 22.7% (n = 349) classified as reviews. International collaboration was observed in 6.5% (n = 100) of the articles. Within the compilation of the ten most prolific authors in this region, 90% of them are from Brazil. This observed pattern extends to affiliations as well, wherein the Universidade de São Paulo emerges as the most active institution (n = 255 documents). This arrangement firmly establishes Brazil’s prominence as the preeminent country in the region concerning cancer genomics research, showcasing robust collaboration networks both regionally and intercontinentally. An important transition in the studied hot topics over the last 20 years was identified, from the exploration of the human genome and the characterization of genomic and proteomic cancer profiles (1997–2010) to an in-depth investigation of cancer stem cells and personalized medicine (2011–2023). Among the array of cancer types under study, predominant attention has been directed towards breast, lung, prostate, and leukemia. Conclusion: Over the course of the past 26 years, a favorable and notable evolution has characterized cancer genomics research within Latin America, with Brazil leading the way, which possess a robust network of regional and intercontinental collaboration. Furthermore, the lines of research and hot topics have change in harmony with the region’s objectives, strategies, and requisites.

Scientific research, especially international research collaboration, is crucial to deal successfully with the epidemic. This article aims to review the response modes, and especially the international collaboration characteristic, of the academic community to similar public health events in the past. Based on relevant studies of four major public health emergencies in the past, the major public health emergencies were regarded as ‘new knowledge’ in the academic field. By using knowledge diffusion indicators, such as the breadth and speed of diffusion, and combined with the development characteristics of the event, this article explores the diffusion characteristics of the four major public health emergencies in the academic exchange system and then identifies the academic community’s response mode to the outbreaks. In addition, the characteristics of international collaboration in response to the public health events and the impact of international collaboration on the academic community’s response are analysed. Through the analysis of the international collaboration network, the cooperative groups and core countries in the research collaboration network related to the major public health emergencies are obtained. In terms of COVID-19, it is found that the response speed and intensity of scientists have been significantly improved, but more focus should be given to international collaboration. Our findings could be beneficial to both decision-makers and researchers in policy formulation and conducting research, respectively, to optimally deal with COVID-19 and possible outbreaks in the future. © The Author(s) 2021.",7

Identifying the current trends and hotspots in breastfeeding research can further advance understanding in the field. Research Aim: This study aimed to review the basic and conceptual structure of the literature on breastfeeding from a macro perspective. Methods: The dataset for this study included 8,509 articles published between 1980 and 2022 accessed through the Web of Science database. Bibliometric methods were used to assess the growth direction of the literature on breastfeeding, the publication performance by country, influential journals and articles, co-citation networks, and keywords. Results: Research on breastfeeding developed slowly until the 2000s, at which point the speed of growth increased. The United States was the country in which most of the breastfeeding research was produced as well as being at the center of international collaborative networks. An examination of author productivity established that there was no specialization in breastfeeding. The results of citation and keyword analyses demonstrated that the literature on breastfeeding is sensitive to current developments, and the psychological aspects of breastfeeding have been intensively discussed, especially in recent years. Moreover, our results demonstrate that breastfeeding support programs are a distinct area if interest. Despite the abundance of research available, more studies are needed for specialization in this field.

Collaboration networks, term co-occurrence networks, and co-citation network were analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and the knowledge distribution of the Chinese research on process safety. Work to data has been clustered mainly on safety of chemical processes, fire and explosion, and risk management and accidents. Chinese research contributions are concentrated in only few journals, while the corresponding intellectual base draws on the wider literature focused on understanding and modeling phenomena, and on the broader risk research literature, although to a lesser extent. While various foreign authors are highly cited by Chinese authors, only very few direct collaborations with international scholars are identified. The results are used as a basis for a discussion on future research directions and developments for the community. Increased focus on uncertainty treatment and handling of black swan events, risk evaluation and economic aspects of safety decisions, interorganizational risk management, road and maritime transport of hazardous substances, risk perception and communication, and integrated safety and security assessment, are highlighted as fruitful directions for future scholarship. It is hoped that the insights obtained from this work can facilitate new and consolidated collaborations, as well as further invigorate the Chinese process safety domain, ultimately contributing to improved safety performance of process industries in China and elsewhere. © 2021",7

Due to this fact, coupled with the increasing energy shortfall, shale gas has become an increasingly attractive energy prospect from both an environmental and economic perspective. This development has led to the rapid growth in the number of researchers and publications in the field of shale gas. Although there are few review articles on the state of research on shale gas, the literature lacked a bibliometric analysis. This study is intended to fill the research gap by carrying out a bibliometric analysis of 9247 shale gas articles that were published between 2010 and 2020. The Web of Science database was used to collect the data. The analysis was performed to identify the most productive authors, institutions, countries, and sources, and to visualize existing collaborations as well as provide valuable information which could form the basis for establishing future collaboration. The analysis results revealed that Li J has the highest number of publications on shale gas whereas Loucks RG is the most cited author. The top three countries with the highest number of publications in shale gas research are China, USA, and Canada, while the China University of Petroleum (Beijing), China University of Geosciences, and Southwest Petroleum University China were the three top institutions with the highest number of publications. Fuel, International Journal of Coal Geology, and Marine and Petroleum Geology are the journals with the highest number of published articles on shale gas. The keyword analysis indicated that shale gas, hydraulic fracturing, pore structure, permeability, adsorption, kinetics, pyrolysis, organic matter, thermal maturity, and numerical simulation are the predominant research topics. This showed the multi-dimensional and multi-faceted character of the shale gas field. Besides, it appeared to be an exciting topic for further study that is based on a detailed evaluation of the shale gas literature. In fact, shale gas, hydraulic fracturing (fracking), CO2 sequestration, kinetic, gas adsorption, diffusion, and simulation are becoming emerging research hotspots. The bibliometric analysis that was presented in this study has revealed valuable information about the most active institutions and countries, and the most influential authors in the field of shale gas which could form the basis for establishing future collaboration. Furthermore, it can help researchers to understand the global research trend in shale gas as well as provide references for establishing future research directions. © 2022 by the authors.

New methodologies and systems have been developed to analyze scientific production and performance indicators from large quantities of data available from the scientific databases, such as Web of Science or Scopus. In this paper, we analyzed the international scientific production and co-authorship patterns for the most productive authors from Serbia based on the obtained Web of Science dataset in the period 2006–2013. We performed bibliometric and scientometric analyses together with statistical and collaboration network analysis, to reveal the causes of extraordinary publishing performance of some authors. For such authors, we found significant inequality in distribution of papers over journals and countries of co-authors, using Gini coefficient and Lorenz curves. Most of the papers belong to multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and the field of applied sciences. We have discovered three specific collaboration patterns that lead to high productivity in international collaboration. First pattern corresponds to mega-authorship papers with hundreds of co-authors gathered in specific research groups. The other two collaboration patterns were found in mathematics and multidisciplinary science, mainly application of graph theory and computational methods in physical chemistry. The former pattern results in a star-shaped collaboration network with mostly individual collaborators. The latter pattern includes multiple actors with high betweenness centrality measure and identified brokerage roles. The results are compared with the later period 2014–2023, where high scientific production has been observed in some other fields, such as biology and food science and technology. © 2023, The Author(s).",6

The specific goals were to identify the collaborative relationships between Korean authors and international authors and to explore clusters of institutions, journals, and topics. Methods: Literature was searched in the Web of Science Core Collection on January 30, 2021. The search terms were “SARS-CoV-2” or “COVID” or “novel coronavirus” in the subject field. The search results were limited again to “South Korea” as the country and the publication type of “article.” The measurement tool was Biblioshiny, an app version tool for Bibliometrix. Results: Korean authors published 3.2 times more COVID-19–related articles in journals outside of Korea than in Korean journals. The journals showed three clusters by bibliographic coupling. In contrast, the co-citation network showed four clusters. Only a few journals were included in the clusters in both analyses. The conceptual structure of Keywords Plus by factorial analysis showed two clusters: “pathology and clinical treatment” and “knowledge and attitudes.” Institutions’ collaborative network consisted of four clusters. Korean researchers actively collaborated with international researchers, especially those in the United States. Conclusion: Because only a few Korean journals were included in the journal clusters by both coupling and co-citation network, more active citation of Korean journals is recommended. The identification of human behavior as a distinct theme in COVID-19 research suggests a different focus in this area besides clinical studies. Copyright © 2021 Korean Council of Science Editors",6

A structural network analysis is performed on bibliometric data using co-authorship on scientific publications as an indicator of collaboration between different organisations. We apply a technological innovation system (TIS) framework, quantitatively assessing the TIS functions ‘knowledge creation’ and ‘knowledge diffusion’ in their spatial and sectoral contexts. Network metrics (degree and betweenness centralities), and empirical TIS analyses are used to describe the knowledge functions of the TIS. Our results show that scientific knowledge development has increased as time has progressed, and that university and healthcare sectors have largely been responsible. Results further indicate that, for the national healthcare and national industry sector actors, ties to university and science council actors support scientific knowledge creation. The collaboration networks were found to be sparse, and disjointed, with many actors largely unreachable, indicating barriers to knowledge exchange between actors. Initially the network displayed spatial elements of an internationalised TIS, but over time, the spatial typology changed to that of a nationalised TIS. This shift may be a positive one, as South African research and development activity shifts towards being driven by local actors and towards medical devices which address the South African burden of disease. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",6

The GMF-related research maintains stable growth with established research teams and sufficient funds in the recent years. GMF-related research is a young field with a newly established intellectual base, and widely recognized as bio-science study. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, European Food Research and Technology, Food and Chemical Toxicology were the most active journals in the field. H. Akiyama, R. Teshima, A. Hino and A. Cifuentes were the most prolific authors in GMF-related research. For countries, both the pro-GMF and anti-GMF countries have pushed relevant research, including USA, EU, and Japan.

The landscape was explored through a bibliometric analysis (2000-2013) of relevant scientific papers using co-authorship as an indicator of collaboration. Collaborating institutions thus found were divided into four sectors: academia (A); healthcare (H); industry (I); and science and support (S). A collaboration network was drawn to show the links between the institutions and analysed using network analysis metrics. Centrality measures identified seven dominant local institutions from three sectors. Group densities were used to quantify the extent of collaboration: the A sector collaborated the most extensively both within and between sectors; local collaborations were more prevalent than international collaborations. Translational collaborations (AHI, HIS or AHIS) are considered to be pivotal in fostering medical device innovation that is both relevant and likely to be commercialised.

Method: In July 2021, the Scopus® database was searched for DRFD-related publications (1970–2020) using predetermined search and inclusion criteria. Bibliometric data were extracted from Scopus® and Journal Citation Reports. Retrieved bibliometric indicators were analysed in Biblioshiny, an R Statistical Software interface and reported using descriptive statistics. Results: Forty-seven DRFD-related articles were identified. The annual number of publications showed a significant upward trend increasing from one in 1988 to a peak of six in 2018 (P < 0.001). The majority of identified articles (n = 31, 66%) were published in the last decade (2011–2020). Basic/clinical research accounted for 87% (n = 41) of publications and 14 (30%) investigated the screening and/or prevention of DRFD.

Funding was reported in 15 (32%) articles; 12 (26%) were supported by public national grants vs. three (6%) reporting industry-sponsorship. Conclusion: DRFD articles authored by NZ researchers have increased over the past five decades. Despite NZ researchers having increased their global impact through collaborative networks, most of the research was classified as low-level evidence, with limited focus on Indigenous Māori and limited financial support and funding. Increased funding for interventional research is required to enable a higher level of evidence-based and practice-changing research to occur. With rates of diabetes-related amputations higher in Māori future research must focus on reducing inequalities in diabetes-related outcomes for Māori by specifically targeting the prevention and screening of DRFD in primary care settings in NZ. © 2022, The Author(s).",5

In this paper, we employ bibliometric methods and social network analysis to explore the patterns and dynamics of scientific collaboration network of fuel cells. A total of 20,358 international collaborative publications in the fuel cell field published during 1998-2017 were collected from Web of Science. We use a series of indicators to address multiple facets of research collaboration and evolution patterns. Results show that international collaboration has been increasing and the characteristics of the scientific network have changed over time. The collaboration network presented a highly uneven distribution, while the sign of decline began to show. The trend of consolidation was presented with one cluster around North America-Asia, one around Europe, and a small emerging collaborating cluster around West Asia. European and North American countries had relatively higher international collaboration rate than Asian countries but lower publishing volume. Two modes of international collaboration exist: Germany, France and UK collaborate with a wide range of countries, while Singapore, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan concentrate on collaborating with few main countries. Microbial fuel cell had developed as a new prominent area in the international collaboration, and the most popular catalysts were nanoparticle and graphene/carbon nanotubes. This study presents a picture of international collaboration from multi-dimension view and provides insights in facilitating more vigorous collaborations in fuel cells. © 2018 by the authors.",5

A study that comprehensively maps and aggregates this research field is missing. Approach: Using tools of bibliometric analysis (bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis and co-occurrence analysis), we map the research at the boundary between learning and working in a scoping review study. Our study considers peer-reviewed articles published between 2011 and 2020 and recorded in Scopus. In total, 5,474 articles are included in our analysis. Findings: Focusing on the intellectual structure of the research field, we identified the most publishing and most cited countries, journals, and authors, as well as latent collaborative networks among countries, journals, and authors. Furthermore, we used references and keywords to identify the conceptual structure of the research field and distinguished four types of conceptual clusters: motor clusters, highly developed and isolated clusters, emerging or declining clusters, and basic and transversal clusters. Conclusions: Research at the boundary between learning and working is highly parcelled out internationally. This scientific parcelling represents a disadvantage for exchanging ideas and accumulating knowledge. In addition to forming a parcelled field, a dividing line runs between centre, periphery and excluded countries and scientists. Especially scientists from developing countries and nations, economies in transition and those from post-conflict situations are excluded from the international discourse. This situation is more than just a disadvantage for the exchange of ideas and the accumulation of knowledge. Instead, there is a systematic bias in the research landscape here. © 2021 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training. All rights reserved.",5

We found greater than nationwide specialisation in biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology, immunology and microbiology, and pharmacology, while psychology proved to be the most prominent emerging area. The publication in most cited journals together with national and international collaboration enhanced research visibility. More citable papers were published on basic than clinical medicine, and the number of citations received by the former was also larger. The higher citation rate in basic medicine may also be explained by the bigger percentage of papers published ininternational instead domestic journals.

However, literature on scientific production and collaboration through bibliometric and network analysis is still lacking. Based on the data extracted from the Web of Science from 2014-2020 with 6790 records, the emerging trends and collaboration patterns of blockchain technology are studied with the use of bibliometrics and network analysis. The study asserts (i) the impact of open-access publication on the growth and visibility of literature, (ii) the collaboration patterns and it’s impact on team size, (iii) the ranking of countries based on their national and international collaboration, and (iv) thematic analysis of literature. The results show growth in the literature since 2017, and open-access publications have received more citations. Very few authors are actively working in the field, as only 73.7% of authors have published a single paper on the blockchain. China published the highest number of papers, followed by the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Singapore published a large number of papers with international collaboration and Russia with national collaboration, whereas the USA showed a balance between national and international publications. Finally, thematic analysis figured out the five key themes as supply chain management, smart contract, security, distributed ledger technology, and internet of things in contrast to the blockchain.

It categorizes and benchmarks risks affecting maritime transport resilience, including climate change, geopolitical conflicts, and public health events. Previous research focuses on climate change-related risks, primarily sea-level rise and storms, evolving from qualitative to quantitative methods. Research on public health events, especially pandemics, has emerged, highlighting global supply chain resilience and maritime transport. However, more comprehensive economic evaluations utilizing analytical models and simulations are needed to assess costs and benefits of adaptation strategies. Limited research exists on geopolitical risks and their impact on maritime transport resilience and international trade, with fragmented studies lacking attention in this critical research direction. Recent conflicts like the Sino-US trade conflict, Russia-Ukraine war, and Israeli-Palestinian conflict have profoundly affected maritime transport resilience, international trade, and the global economy. Future studies should prioritize economic implications of maritime transport resilience, particularly regarding geopolitical risks. In-depth economic evaluations, analytical modeling, and numerical simulations are necessary to inform policymakers and industry practitioners for enhancing resilience in the maritime shipping sector.

The research also aims to investigate how such research evolved since its launch in 2001. Design/methodology/approach: Wikipedia has grown to be the biggest online encyclopedia in terms of comprehensiveness, reach and coverage. Based on 1,040 PubMed Wikipedia documents written by 5,280 authors over two decades (2001–2021), this paper conducts a bibliometric review of the intellectual structure of scholarly publications dealing with Wikipedia. Findings: Results show that annual scholarly publications on Wikipedia growth rate is 13.26. Major outlets publishing Wikipedia’s research are PloS One, the Journal of Medical Internet Research, Nucleic Acids Research, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, Bioinformatics and the International Journal of Medical Informatics. Results also show that the author collaboration network is very sparse, signifying rather negligible collaboration among the authors. Furthermore, results reveal that the Wikipedia research institutions’ collaboration network reflects what is sometimes termed Wikipedia’s “North-South divide,” indicating limited collaboration between rich and poor nations’ institutions. Finally, the multiple correspondence analysis applied to obtain the Wikipedia research conceptual map and its intellectual structure reveals the intellectual thrust and the diversity of the scholarly publications dealing with Wikipedia.

Despite extensive research, the pathophysiological mechanisms of glaucoma remain unclear, and no complete cure has yet been identified for glaucoma. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs can serve as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for glaucoma; however, there are few bibliometric studies that focus on using microRNAs in glaucoma research. Here, we have adopted a bibliometric analysis in the field of microRNAs in glaucoma research to manifest the current tendencies and research hotspots and to present a visual map of the past and emerging tendencies in this field. In this study, we retrieved publications in the Web of Science database that centered on this field between 2007 and 2022. Next, we used VOSviewer, CiteSpace, Scimago Graphica, and Microsoft Excel to present visual representations of a co-occurrence analysis, co-citation analysis, tendencies, hotspots, and the contributions of authors, institutions, journals, and countries/regions. The United States was the main contributor. Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science has published the most articles in this field. Over the past 15 years, there has been exponential growth in the number of publications and citations in this field across various countries, organizations, and authors. Thus, this study illustrates the current trends, hotspots, and emerging frontiers and provides new insight and guidance for searching for new diagnostic biomarkers and clinical trials for glaucoma in the future.

Their effects have a severe impact on the economy in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environments that are increasingly transversal to productive sectors and activities. Researchers have intensified their academic production of multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) in recent years. This article analyzes the research agenda through a systematic review of scientific articles in the Web of Science Core Collection according to the Journal Citation Report (JCR), both in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE). According to the selected search criteria, 909 articles on MCDM published between 1979 and 2022 in Web of Science journals in the business and management categories were located. A bibliometric analysis of the main thematic clusters, the international collaboration networks, and the bibliographic coupling of articles was carried out. In addition, the analysis period is divided into two subperiods (1979–2008 and 2009–2022), establishing 2008 as the threshold, the year of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), to assess the evolution of the research agenda at the beginning of systemic disruptions. The bibliometric analysis allows the identification of the motor, basic, specialized, and emerging themes of each subperiod. The results show the similarities and differences between the academic debate before and after the GFC. The evidence found allows academics to be guided in their high-impact research in business and management using MCDM methodologies to address contemporary challenges.

In response to the knowledge explosion resulting from the rapid growth of publications, we applied bibliometric analysis to explore the research profile and topical trends in this field. Methods: The articles and reviews related to AI in arthroplasty were retrieved from 2000 to 2021. The Java-based Citespace, VOSviewer, R software-based Bibiometrix, and an online platform systematically evaluated publications by countries, institutions, authors, journals, references, and keywords. Results: A total of 867 publications were included. Over the past 22 years, the number of AI-related publications in the field of arthroplasty has grown exponentially. The United States was the most productive and academically influential country. The Cleveland Clinic was the most prolific institution. Most publications were published in high academic impact journals. However, collaborative networks revealed a lack and imbalance of inter-regional, inter-institutional, and inter-author cooperation. Two emerging research areas represented the development trends: major AI subfields such as machine learning and deep learning, and the other is research related to clinical outcomes. Conclusion: AI in arthroplasty is evolving rapidly.

This bibliometric analysis elucidates the knowledge landscape of sarcopenia research by synthesizing growth trajectories, collaborative networks, and intellectual structures within the literature. Scientific publications spanning 1993–2023 were retrieved from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. VOSviewer, Biblioshiny, and ScientoPy software tools facilitated visualization and analysis of bibliometric trends. Results showed that after a seminal 2010 consensus definition paper, sarcopenia publications increased over 20-fold by 2021, following an initial gradual growth and then exponential expansion. China led in output volume; however, Western nations exhibited higher international collaboration. Prolific institutions clustered within Asia and Europe, although Australian and Canadian centers were also represented, reflecting expanding global networks. Core journals were dispersed across clinical medicine, gerontology, and nutrition. A co-occurrence network analysis of keywords delineated three predominant research domains: physical disability, muscle diagnostic metrics, and clinical prognostic outcomes. Keywords like “mobility” in the disability domain reflect sarcopenia's functional impacts. This novel perspective comprehensively maps sarcopenia's evolving knowledge landscape, despite limitations in incorporating citations and text mining. Practical contributions include identifying key areas for further research, including consolidating diagnostic methods through collaborative initiatives, exploring lifestyle interventions, and investigating sarcopenia across diverse specialties. By elucidating trends in growth, collaboration, and intellectual structure, this analysis offers data-driven perspectives to strategically combat this expanding public health challenge. The synthesis of publication trends provides both a novel scientometric perspective and practical insights to inform future sarcopenia research and guide public health policy. © 2024 Nevzat Demirci.

Despite enormous efforts and progress in diagnosis and therapy, there are still many aspects of uncertainty leading to an increasing scientific interest in this topic. As it is challenging to survey all articles regarding CD and to measure their scientific importance, this study uses reliable scientometric tools to evaluate the global research output on CD related to quantitative and qualitative aspects and in chronological and geographical context. Study: We conducted a scientometric analysis to assess all global research activity on CD from 1900 until 2013. We analyzed the research output of countries, individual institutions, journals, authors and their collaborative networks and depicted our findings by density-equalizing map projections. Results: The worldwide research architecture indicated that the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France play leading role regarding scientific activity, h-indices, multilateral and bilateral cooperations. There is a dramatic increase of collaborative publications since the 1990s, which underlines recent studies pronouncing that the scientific progress will be mainly depending on international cooperations. Conclusions: We conclude that the field of CD is constantly progressing, in which the influence of international cooperations on the scientific productivity is of major and growing importance.

Methods: In this study, 4432 publications in the first decade and 4012 publications in the second decade were quantitatively analyzed and visualized using visualization software such as VOSviewer (Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands), CiteSpace (Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pa), and Scimago Graphica (SCImago Lab, Spain). Results: Institutions in the United States had the highest number of publications through the 2 decades, whereas Brazil, South Korea, and China achieved significant improvements in performance in the second decade compared with the first. Closer collaborative networks among scholars were revealed in the second decade. The cocitation analysis of the journals showed that highly cited journals included more professional orthodontic journals in the second decade than in the first decade. Conclusions: Bibliometric analysis of publications in 3 major orthodontic journals over two 10-year periods revealed a trend of diversification in countries and institutions participating in publishing, international collaborations, and collaboration networks among authors in the field of orthodontics during the 2 decades. © 2024 American Association of Orthodontists",3

In this context, there is a fragmentation of knowledge as PL involves different disciplines such as education, psychology, and linguistics. This is despite the existence of a large body of literature on PL. However, many studies focus on specific topics, which makes it difficult for researchers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current status, research hotspots, and trends in PL research, leaving a knowledge gap. Therefore, this study adopts a quantitative research approach for the literature data between 1992 and 2022 for a period of thirty years. This study used arithmetic in Microsoft Excel and bibliometric visualization tools, including VOSviewer and Biblioshiny. The aim was to analyze the current situation, trends, and future development of literacy at the preschool level, providing a scientific basis for preschool practice and policy development. An analysis was performed on 1208 screened documents from the Scopus database in Excel, resulting in the identification of annual publication trends, the 20 most cited documents, the 15 most productive authors, the top 10 institutions, and the 20 countries with the highest number of publications. Visual collaborative networks and co-occurrence analysis maps via VOSviewer and Bibliometrix were also conducted. The study found that the number of research papers published on PL has shown a steadily increasing trend, that the United States is a pioneer in the field of preschool literacy and is increasingly collaborating and researching with other countries, and that international connections are growing between publications and authors. Furthermore, preschool institutions, teachers, and families have positive attitudes towards preschool literacy, as reflected in theoretical research, teaching practice, and sustainable knowledge construction. Meanwhile, the findings of this study also revealed that new PL research has been extended to emerging literacy skills, family-based literacy models, and literacy intervention models. Future researchers can benefit from this study by increasing collaborative research that can sustainably add to the body of knowledge and improving the sustainability of PL. © 2023 by the authors.",3

Despite its importance, the dynamics of scientific networks among these organizations have not been widely studied. This paper examined scientific collaboration network of NGOs in South America, based on a systematic bibliographic publications survey with member organizations of the Forum for the Conservation of the Patagonian Sea and areas of influence (FCPS). We describe the countries, research funds, types of institutions, topics covered, and where these studies were conducted. Using a network perspective, we analyzed the structure of scientific collaborations, identifying relevant measures of the social capital network. The results show that this network is growing and expanding over time, with greater participation of institutions and research funds from the north-hemisphere countries, and composed mainly of universities, research institutes, NGOs, and government agencies. Most studies address animal function and behavior, impacts of human activities, and management along with marine area conservation, located mostly in Argentina. Northern hemisphere organizations and forum´s international NGOs, are the central actors in the scientific networks, working closely with domestic research institutes, forum NGOs, and universities from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. We found that participation in research funds, time frame in the network, and physical presence of forum organizations are the strongest predictors of social capital. Our results also offer new insights into the role of ENGOs in supporting, scientific knowledge for marine conservation policy options, especially in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",3

The growing number of publications every year makes difficult to monitor the progress of this research domain, therefore there is a broad interest for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventions in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. Our goal is to analyze the scientific activity of authors who published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of CP intervention studies. To identify the active researchers, institutions, and countries, we used scientometric and bibliometric indicators that assess their productivity, collaborations, and the citations (utilization/usefulness of their studies), also paying attention to the institutional background and the network structure of national and international collaboration. We used Scopus to search for articles and included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of intervention studies, a total of 180 works, in our sample. Our results showed active and large communities of prolific authors and groups of authors with diverse institutional background. Most institutions are universities, hospitals, but we found various other organizations among them. Most of the universities are leading educational institutions according to international rankings; some of them are among the top-ranking ones. In geographical terms, the North American, Australian, and European regions are the most active and most interconnected ones. We assume organizations other than scientific collaboration networks also play a major role in the productivity and dissemination of scientific knowledge in this research area. As an example, we could mention the network, including the US, Australian and European registers. Authors living and working in the Far East, the Middle East or in South America also started to publish relevant articles in the 2010s.

Scientists experience numerous challenges to survey >40,000 items that have been published on UC  since 1900, to evaluate their scientific impact or to identify collaborative networks publishing the most relevant work. Hence,  no current, detailed and comprehensive knowledge regarding the worldwide research architecture of UC has been established until  now.Methods:We conducted a scientometric study employing the previously validated NewQIS (New Quality and Quantity Indices in  Science) platform to quantify the global research activity in the field of UC. Hereby, the total research productivity,  scientific output of countries, individual institutions, authors, journals, their collaborative networks as well as  semiqualitative aspects were assessed. Results were visualized via state-of-the-art density-equalizing mapping  projections.Results:The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom play leading roles regarding scientific activity,  multilateral and bilateral cooperations. Within the past decades, research on UC diversified into a field covering numerous  subject areas.

Eighteen months (2020 January 1-2021 June 30) COVID-19 publication data of 46 Sub-Saharan African countries was collected from Scopus for analysis. Country of affiliation of the authors and funding agencies data was analyzed to understand country contributions, collaboration pattern and funding sources. USA (23.08%) and the UK (19.63%), the top two external contributors, collaborated with Sub-Saharan African countries about three times more than other countries. Collaborative papers between Sub-Saharan African countries - without contributions from outside the region- made up less than five per cent of the sample, whereas over 50% of the papers were written in collaboration with researchers from outside the region. Organizations that are in the USA and the UK funded 45% of all the COVID-19 research from Sub-Saharan Africa. 53.44% of all the funding from Sub-Saharan African countries came from South African organizations. This study provides evidence that pan-African COVID-19 research collaboration is low, perhaps due to poor funding and lack of institutional support within Sub-Saharan Africa. This mirrors the collaborative features of science in Sub-Saharan Africa before the COVID-19 pandemic. The high volume of international collaboration during the pandemic is a good development. There is also a strong need to forge more robust pan-African research collaboration networks, through funding from Africa's national and regional government organizations, with the specific objective of meeting local COVID-19 and other healthcare needs.  © 2021 Toluwase Victor Asubiaro et al., published by De Gruyter.",3

The results reveal significant growth in the field, with a surge in publications particularly in the last decade. The top journals for publishing include Zootaxa, JMBA, and Zoologia. However, despite this growth, the overall impact of the research output remains somewhat limited, with most articles receiving relatively low numbers of citations, and those with more citations have broader research questions. This research community directed its efforts especially to taxonomy and phylogenetics research, community ecology, and physiology (ecotoxicology). These topics formed a common ground for more specialized themes. International collaboration was driven by research specialization, better infrastructure, and funding of developed countries. However, seeking collaborations with countries from the global south can also enrich the research conducted by the Brazilian community and stimulate new scientific inquiries.

However, little is known about the evolution patterns of cancer research communities and the influencing factors of their research capacity and impact, which is affected not only by the social networks established through research collaboration but also by the knowledge networks in which the research projects are embedded. Methods: The focus of this study was narrowed to a specific topic – 'synthetic lethality’ – in cancer research. This field has seen vibrant growth and multidisciplinary collaboration in the past decade. Multi-level collaboration and knowledge networks were established and analysed on the basis of bibliometric data from ‘synthetic lethality’-related cancer research papers. Negative binomial regression analysis was further applied to explore how node attributes within these networks, along with other potential factors, affected paper citations, which are widely accepted as proxies for assessing research capacity and impact. Results: Our study revealed that the synthetic lethality-based cancer research field is characterized by a knowledge network with high integration, alongside a collaboration network exhibiting some clustering. We found significant correlations between certain factors and citation counts. Specifically, a leading status within the nation-level international collaboration network and industry involvement were both found to be significantly related to higher citations. In the individual-level collaboration networks, lead authors’ degree centrality has an inverted U-shaped relationship with citations, while their structural holes exhibit a positive and significant effect. Within the knowledge network, however, only measures of structural holes have a positive and significant effect on the number of citations. Conclusions: To enhance cancer research capacity and impact, non-leading countries should take measures to enhance their international collaboration status. For early career researchers, increasing the number of collaborators seems to be more effective. University–industry cooperation should also be encouraged, enhancing the integration of human resources, technology, funding, research platforms and medical resources. Insights gained through this study also provide recommendations to researchers or administrators in designing future research directions from a knowledge network perspective. Focusing on unique issues especially interdisciplinary fields will improve output and influence their research work. © The Author(s) 2024.",2

On the basis of highly cited papers data, this paper adopts spatial scientometrics and social network analysis to investigate the geography, position and link of science cities between 2007 and 2017. The results are demonstrated below: (1) The two seemingly paradoxical trends, the regional concentration and global spread, coexist in the process of knowledge production, which are rapidly reshaping the global pattern of science. (2) The whole knowledge collaboration network has been dominated by the Global North cities, while the rise of the Global South cities has an increasing influence in the network, both driving the evolution of the world order. (3) The number of scientific collaborations between cities has increased dramatically, while domestic collaborations have higher strength than international collaborations.

However, little is known about whether and how the initial steps of getting to know other researchers translates into effective collaborations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution and co-evolution of an academic social network and a collaborative research network (using co-authorship as a proxy measure of the latter), and simultaneously examine the effect of individual researcher characteristics (e.g. gender, seniority or workplace) on their evolving relationships. We used longitudinal data from an international network in primary care cancer research: the CanTest Collaborative (CanTest). Surveys were distributed amongst CanTest researchers to map who knows who (the ‘academic social network’). Co-authorship relations were derived from Scopus (the ‘collaborative network’). Stochastic actor-oriented models were employed to investigate the evolution and co-evolution of both networks. Visualizing the development of the CanTest network revealed that researchers within CanTest get to know each other quickly and also start collaborating over time (evolution of the academic social network and collaborative network respectively). Results point to a stable and solid academic social network that is particularly encouraging towards more junior researchers; yet differing for male and female researchers (the effect of individual researcher characteristics). Moreover, although the academic social network and the research collaborations do not grow at the same pace, the benefit of creating academic social relationships to stimulate effective research collaboration is clearly demonstrated (co-evolution of both networks).

Many network studies of men’s and women’s collaboration rely on bounded case studies of single disciplines and/or single countries and limited measures related to the collaborative process. We deploy network analysis on the scholarly database Scopus to gain insight into gender inequity across regions and subject areas and to better understand contextual underpinnings of stagnancy. Using a dataset of over 1.2 million authors and 144 million collaborative relationships, we capture international and unbounded co-authorship networks that include intra- and inter-disciplinary co-authorship ties across time (2009–2013). We describe how gender informs structural features and status differences in network relationships, focusing on men and women authors in 16 region-subject pairs. We pay particular attention to how connected authors are (first- and second-order degree centrality), attributes of authors’ collaborative relationships (including the “quality” and other characteristics of these ties), tendencies towards gender homophily (proportion of same-gender ties), and the nature of men’s and women’s interdisciplinary and international reach. Men have more advantageous first-order connections, yet second-order collaborative profiles look more similar. Men and women exhibit homophilous attachment to authors of the same gender, consistent over time. There is notable variation in the level of gender disparity within subjects across countries. We discuss this variation in the context of global trends in men’s and women’s scientific participation and cultural- and country-level influences on the organization and production of science. © 2023, The Author(s).",2

Based on the databases of the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and the Web of Science core collection (WoS), this paper collected archaeology-related papers published by Chinese scholars in Chinese and world core journals (CCJs and WCJs for short), then filtered translated and original articles about foreign archaeology in CCJs, as well as all original archaeological articles in WCJs. Using Excel, CiteSpace and VOSviewer visualization software, we analyzed these data to give a bird’s-eye view of how archaeology research in Mainland China has become internationalized. Chinese archaeology has seen active-interrupt-active phases characterized by learning from foreign academics in the last century. Over the past two decades, the number of articles published in WCJs by scholars from Mainland China has increased significantly, and most research topics are at the forefront of international scholarship. Collaboration networks largely expanded, with the number of Mainland China–led articles increasing significantly. Archaeological papers written by researchers from Mainland China have appeared in a more extensive range of journals, including those with high impact factors. However, articles related to joint Sino-foreign archaeological projects were mostly published in CCJs. The archaeology-related articles published by Chinese scholars in WCJs occupied only a small proportion of all archaeological articles in WCJs. Compared to articles in CCJs, the number of those published by Chinese scholars in WCJs is a drop in the ocean. Therefore the internationalization is not yet a dominant trend and with the introduction of the new inward-looking policy we need more time to observe where the trends of internationalization and localization in Chinese archaeology are heading. © 2023, The Author(s).",2

Collaboration and networking among researchers and institutes are fundamental to address the multi-faceted issues confronting the fisheries sector in India. Collaborative research pattern among ICAR-Fisheries Research Institutes (IFRIs) and with R&D organisations in other countries was studied for a period of 20 years (2000-2019). Research productivity and focus areas of research of these institutes were also assessed through bibliometrics of publications extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The search yielded 4,557 publications and a significant increase in the number of publications from 2000 to 2019 was evident . Major chunk of these papers (87%) was published in collaboration with National Institutes while only 10.6% had international collaboration especially with the United States of America (USA), Australia and Japan. A positive correlation (p<0.01) was observed between the extent of collaboration (both national and international) and the average citation per paper. The average impact factor of the journals carrying fisheries research papers with at least one international author was higher than those in which the papers were with only Indian authors. This leads us to hypothesise that the network of IFRIs with international research institutions aids in increasing the quality, visibility and impact of research. The co-authorship pattern revealed a gradual reduction in single and two-authored papers during the last 20 years, while multi-authored papers exhibited an increasing trend. The study showed that the collaboration network in fisheries research is growing fast; collaborating countries in the network increased gradually, and the number of authors and publications increased almost exponentially, as indicated by the growth rate and doubling time in research publications. The present study provides a multi-dimensional overview of the impact of research publications from IFRIs and provides specific insights in to the research managers to plan and strategise their collaborations to enhance the influence of fisheries research in India. © 2022, Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

We conducted a bibliometric analysis of the SUDEP literature with the aim of presenting its structure, performance, and trends. Methods: The Scopus database was searched in April 2023 for documents explicitly detailing SUDEP in their title, abstract, or keywords. After the removal of duplicate documents, bibliometric analysis was performed using the R package bibliometrix and the program VOSviewer. Performance metrics were computed to describe the literature's annual productivity, most relevant authors and countries, and most important publications. Science mapping was performed to visualize the relationships between research constituents by constructing a country collaboration network, co-authorship network, keyword co-occurrence network, and document co-citation network. Results: A total of 2140 documents were analyzed. These documents were published from 1989 onward, with an average number of citations per document of 25.78. Annual productivity had been on the rise since 2006. Out of 6502 authors, five authors were in both the list of the ten most productive and the list of the ten most cited authors: Devinsky O, Sander JW, Tomson T, Ryvlin P, and Lhatoo SD. The USA and the United Kingdom were the most productive and cited countries. Collaborations between American authors and European authors were particularly rich. Prominent themes in the literature included those related to pathophysiology (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, apnea, autonomic dysfunction), epilepsy characteristics (e.g., epilepsy type, refractoriness, antiseizure medications), and epidemiology (e.g., incidence, age, sex). Emerging themes included sleep, genetics, epilepsy refractoriness, and non-human studies. Significance: The body of literature on SUDEP is rich, fast-growing, and benefiting from frequent international collaborations.

Results: From 1992 to 2022, 19,764 articles on medical and health collaboration between China and ASEAN were filtered for analysis. The number of China–ASEAN collaborations has shown a clear upward trend over the years, indicating a gradually closer and improved collaboration relationship overall. The institutional collaboration network between China and ASEAN countries was obviously clustered, and the network connectivity was limited. The substantial differences between the median and mean values of citation impact of China–ASEAN medical and health research collaboration reflected that the collaboration was ‘less’ but ‘better’. The dominance share of collaboration between China and the main ASEAN countries was fluctuating upward and has become more and more stable after 2004. Most of the China–ASEAN collaboration focused on their own characteristic research topics. In recent years, collaboration in infectious diseases and public health had expanded significantly, while other research topics had maintained in a complementary development trend. Conclusion: Collaboration between China and ASEAN in the medical and health field has exhibited a progressively closer relationship, and the trend of complementary research has remained stable. However, there are still areas of concern, including the limited scale of collaboration, narrow scope of participation and weak dominance. © The Author(s) 2023.",2

This study is a descriptive bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed literature on vaccine hesitancy from a behavioural perspective, covering publications from 2015 to 2022. The study used data retrieved from the Scopus database to examine bibliometric indicators, including publication trends, citation analysis and top-cited articles, the most impactful journals in which vaccine hesitancy articles appear, the most productive and influential countries from which research was produced, international collaborations between countries, leading authors, author collaboration networks and research themes. Predictably, the literature on vaccine hesitancy has increased significantly since 2020. The most impactful journals in which this research appeared are primarily linked to the academic fields of health and behavioural studies, social sciences, health psychology, and health communications. The majority of the extant vaccine hesitancy literature, research collaborations and its authors are associated with the United States and European nations. Furthermore, analysing the most frequently occurring terms in the titles and abstracts of the retrieved 352 articles yielded four research themes. These included analyses of individual predispositions towards vaccination encompassing attitudes, behaviour, risk perceptions, belief, fear, and intentions towards vaccines and vaccination. Other prominent themes included vaccine hesitancy in general and concerning COVID-19 vaccines specifically, child vaccination and interventions to increase vaccine uptake and implications of social media and information with respect to vaccine hesitancy. The findings indicate that research productivity around vaccine hesitancy was greatest in western and high-income countries, revealing the need to invest and conduct further research in low- and middle-income countries to understand its global nuances better. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2

This study aimed to assess the scientific profile and research trends related to periodontal disease in pregnancy through a bibliometric approach. Methods: Publications about periodontal disease in pregnancy from 2000 to 2022 were extracted from Science Citation Index Expanded. The knowledge networks of countries, institutions, authors, journals, references, and keywords in this field were constructed using the Citespace, VOSviewer, Bibliometrix, and BIBLIOMETRIC.COM platforms. Furthermore, correlations between the characteristics of countries and the number or impact of publications were analyzed. Results: 1162 original studies and reviews were included. There was a trend toward increased publications and citations in this field. The United States had the highest academic productivity and impact by a significant margin, while correlation analyses indicated that economic power may correlate with national scientific activity. The University of North Carolina and Offenbacher S were the most influential institution and author, respectively, taking center stage in the collaborative networks. However, only several loose connections between countries or institutions were identified in the global collaborative network analysis. Six of the top ten most productive journals were in Q1 in the Journal Citation Report, and there was intensive interaction between different research subfields, such as immunology, molecular biology, and microbiology. Frontier topics were primarily clustered in two areas: (1) oral micro-biology, such as microbiome, oral bacteria, and Fusobacterium nucleatum; and (2) public health, such as quality of life, pregnancy outcomes, oral health, obesity, and classification. Conclusion: Since 2000, periodontal disease in pregnancy is receiving increasingly widespread attention and is rapidly evolving at a multidisciplinary level. Oral microbiological pathogenesis and public health impact-related research deserve more exploration and may be the future direction of research. Enhanced Collaboration and interdisciplinary communication may further facilitate progress in this discipline. © 2023 Liu et al.",2

It gives the positive impact and very beneficial for both parties so this scientific research network becomes an important component in measuring performance and ranking institutions for national and international levels. The interviews result show that the amount of collaboration alone cannot fair to be used as performance measurement, because in general the successful collaboration can be established to other institutions with higher ranks, which will give a good quality impact to the institution. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new performance measurement formula using case studies in Indonesia. Scientific collaboration networks are generated based on data from lecturers and institutions, especially research outputs indexed in the SINTA (Science and Technological Index). SINTA is the largest and most comprehensive portal for measuring research performance in Indonesia. The formula proposed in this research is to consider the number and weighting based on the score of the institution in the previous year to calculate a new score of the performance of the scientific collaboration network.

In this country, various State institutions have carried out the study of marine science for several decades, but their academic development has not been analyzed. The formal evaluation of scientific research represents a crucial opportunity to define long-term policies requiring greater knowledge of the territory and its resources. In this context, this work carries out a systematic and quantitative review of Uruguay authors' international publications over three decades. The productivity indicators trend is evaluated concerning context variables, predominant research topics are identified, and collaboration networks are characterized. We collected and analyzed data on marine science articles in which an author or co-author is affiliated to an institution in Uruguay from 1990 to 2018 using the Scopus database. It was found that scientific activity measured by a bibliographic analysis showed an increase in the number of articles, authors, and research topics but nowadays show signs of stagnation. Moreover, specific indicators show a great degree of centralism (institutional and authorial), low dynamism, and decreased international collaboration. The largest academic capacities are focused in specific biological disciplines, with little physics and almost nil in geology and chemistry. Decentralization and strengthening sectorial funding for marine science will boost Uruguay's discipline for facing future challenges. © 2021, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar. All rights reserved.",2

It is a methodology for the educational field that facilitates the construction of substantive theories about the study realities with a high level of ecological validity. The construction of these theoretical frameworks helps teachers and researchers to obtain a potentially profound and exact comprehension of the educational dynamics from an ecological perspective. Therefore, based on these theories, it is possible to design and apply contextualized action plans. Proof of this is the considerable increase in educational productions based on GT in recent years. Until now, there has been a lack of studies designed to analyze the progress and current state of the research on GT in the field of education. Thus, in order to offer synthesized information, this article presents a scientometric analysis of the productions indexed in the Web of Knowledge (WoS) impact databases of the Institute for Scientific Information, which includes the following thematic categories in the SSCI and SCI databases: Education & Educational Research; Psychology Educational; Education Scientific Disciplines; Education Special. The sample was composed of all the products published in journals during the period from 1975 to 2013, representing a total of 688 indexed articles. The results indicate that the production is in an exponential growth phase, confirming the statements of the experts who consider GT to be a promising methodology in the educational field. Furthermore, based on the results obtained, and using indicators of production, consumption and collaboration, the leading authors, journals and institutions are discussed, and international collaboration networks are described. © 2015, Ministry Education and Science.

The density, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality of UI collaborative networks were calculated in order to ascertain the core countries involved in international UI collaboration. This study investigates university-industry collaborative papers (UI papers) at the global and country levels. At the global level, the results show an increasing trend in UI papers and a stable UI collaboration ratio during the last decade. The average number of authors for UI papers is 4.13, which is higher than that for all other papers. Most UI papers result from two-institution collaboration, but we observed an increase in the number of UI papers produced by multiple universities and industrial entities.

The conceptual and intellectual structure of the construct is analysed via keywords and co-citation pattern mapping. Design/methodology/approach: OI research is rising in popularity, with 118 papers published in 2019, 168 papers in 2020 and 15 publications till February 2021 in the Scopus database. The Scopus database is used to retrieve 55 years of OI studies published between 1965 and 2021. The free bibliometric tools Biblioshiny and VOSviewer are used to analyse 1,034 journal papers. Findings: The result showed that R. Van Dick is the most influential author and the USA is the most involved country in OI research. As per the findings, the Journal of Organizational Behaviour published most of OI research and “corporate social responsibility” and “organizational commitment” seem to be the most used keywords alongside OI. Research limitations/implications: This study will be highly beneficial to OI researchers making their understanding about the construct better. It will also encourage social psychologists to understand the construct utility in workplace social welfare programmes. The research could also help governments and funding bodies to evaluate grant requests. Furthermore, researchers from countries with the lowest proportion of OI studies would be encouraged to spend more time and effort in this area. It will offer insight into international marketing and how individuals and stakeholders perceive and connect with an organization globally. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the important research studies carried out in the domain of OI in the international context. This is also one of the few studies which is spread out across different disciplinary areas including international marketing and management. The success of this paper can open avenues and influence future researchers to study in the OI and related cross-disciplinary areas of international management. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",1

At the same time, there has been growing interest in studying scientific collaboration and its network pattern. Many of these studies on the dynamics of social networks focus on well-established communities, while studies examining the union of communities are rare. As such, the primary purpose of this study is to fill this literature gap by investigating the science education research field that is grounded in cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) through a coauthorship network. Our data include 86 Brazilian science education scholars with their coauthors. In total, we consider 554 unique papers written in English, Portuguese, and Spanish over the past 30 years. We found an increasing trend in coauthored papers, resulting in a higher collaborative coefficient over time. It turns out that the topological metrics support that the considered researchers form a cohesive core-periphery community with relatively few connected components, a high tendency for clustering, relatively low path length, and a heterogeneous distribution of node degree. We have verified that the available community presents structural and dynamic properties of mature research fields, and scholars are introducing their collaborators to one another, creating new social acquaintances resulting in coauthorship. Nevertheless, studies on science education ground in the CHAT framework do not rely on international collaboration. Finally, the conducted analysis indicates several fruitful avenues for future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",1

In Brazil, it is one of the main feed sources for ruminants during the dry season. However, scientific research and publication on FC seem limited and recent. Bibliometric studies allow measuring publication patterns and understanding the evolution of scientific production. Thus, a bibliometric analysis was carried out to evaluate the scientific production on productive aspects, management, and use of FC in animal feed (1800-June 2022). The literature search was based on keywords, including “cactus, cacti, nopal, prickly pear, palma forrageira, cacto, Nopalea, Opuntia, forage, forragem, and forraje”. Data were analyzed using the Bibliometrix tool based on the R language through the Biblioshiny interface. A total of 514 publications were identified, with a predominance of research articles (92.6%). Scientific production includes authors from 40 countries, highlighting Brazil (1094 authors). The main sources were: Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia, Acta Horticulturae, Tropical Animal Health and Production, Revista Caatinga, Journal of the Professional Association for Cactus Development, and Revista Brasileira de Engenharia Agrícola e Ambiental. The 10 most frequent words were: Opuntia, Semiarid, Nopalea, Forage, Cactaceae, Opuntia fícus-indica, Cactus, Cactus pear, Intake, and Digestibility. Scientific production on FC is led by researchers from Brazil, notably from Northeastern Brazil. Publications on the economic evaluation, establishment and maintenance of promising species, soil conservation, micronutrient content and the use of FC as a supplementary source of water, are less frequent.

Its effects on collaboration networks, research impact and knowledge flows drive countries and institutions to quantify and understand this activity. The purpose of this study is to test a new researcher mobility model which was developed and prototyped as a customisable research tool to provide a unified perspective on mobility at macro (national), meso (institutional) and micro (individual) levels. The approach includes multidimensional perspectives, including temporal, geographical, sectoral, directional mobility, that could be used for benchmarking and trend analyses. The model quantifies research mobility volumes and qualifies the mobility flow additional researcher characteristics and productivity indicators. We tested the tool among Sweden’s higher education sector, observing researcher mobility patterns between 1992–2021. Results show a high degree of variability in researcher mobility patterns across institutions, especially when considered by career age. Larger higher education institutions in Sweden tend to see a high level of inter-university mobility: most of the Outflow researchers have international mobility and were affiliated with organisations from diverse sectors. Smaller universities are more adapted to attract early- and retain late-career researchers. One university was identified as an incubator for early-career researchers that go on to high levels of mobility. Another university achieved higher mobility rates by facilitating short-term mobility abroad. The study highlighted a shift in the countries of destination for the Inflow early-career researchers: fewer were affiliated with USA, UK or Japan, while other countries became more prominent (China, Germany, Netherlands, Spain) and new destinations emerged (Brazil, India, Iran). The study emphasized that visiting researchers are consistently more productive, and their research impact is generally higher. With the help of our advanced model, we present a detailed picture of mobility in Sweden and demonstrate the power of this customisable tool. © 2024 Dobre et al.

Previous work has demonstrated that national funding policies can have a significant and positive impact on a country’s global cooperation. The China Scholarship Council (CSC) is a government funding agency established to foster international collaborations among Chinese scholars, particularly in science and technology (S&T) fields critical to modernization. However, there remains a lack of long-term, systematic evaluation of CSC’ performance and impacts. To address this gap, this paper examines the academic outcomes of CSC funding by analyzing bibliometric data from scholarly works published 2008–2022, retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. We found that the number of CSC-funded publications significantly increased during this period, and CSC-funded scholars collaborated with substantially more foreign scholars since the program’s launch compared to other Chinese scholars and the global average. The prevalence of CSC-funded research in S&T fields may be synergistic with broader capacity building efforts, including by enhancing China’s research and development capabilities. Further examining the CSC-funded collaborative network, there is a marked rise in ties with Europe, although the USA remains a key partner. Overall, this study highlights the pivotal role of the CSC in internationalizing China’s research system, positioning the CSC as a model for policymakers who aim to leverage government funding to promote academic achievement through global collaborative research activities. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024.",0

However, the collaboration patterns of DH have not been well studied in terms of development stages and collaboration characteristics. This paper aims to reveal the typical patterns of country-level collaboration in the global environment of DH based on research capacity, network features and influence indicators. Design/methodology/approach: We systematically designed a pipeline procedure based on the methods of bibliometrics and altmetrics to analyze global DH-related publications from two popular databases. The process includes the division of development stages, the identification of typical characteristics, the analysis of collaboration networks and the correlation test for different influences across countries. Findings: The findings show that the collaboration in DH has certain characteristics and evolutionary patterns – with 2007 as the turning point that presents a gradual alteration from the strong competition of nation giants and the dominance of domestic collaboration to diversified international cooperation within regional alliances and a clear positive effect on national influence (both academic and social levels) by international collaboration. Some relevant suggestions are also put forward. Originality/value: The study demonstrates not only the evidence of distinct patterns of country-level collaboration for DH during its evolutionary period as well as collaboration types and structures but also the positive effect of international collaboration on the enhancement of both academic influence and social attention. Moreover, the proposed analytical procedure provides insightful ideas around DH development from both the bibliometric and altmetric views, which can be an extensible framework for other scholarly collaboration research. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",0

IPSAS ushered in a global revolution in public accounting reforms, and Morocco is among the nations that have adopted these standards, starting their implementation several years ago. The integration of IPSAS mobilises a theoretical and conceptual framework encompassing the theories and New Public Management (NPM), as well as the theory of public value. The aim is to harmonise accounting practices with global standards, thereby enhancing the transparency, comparability and credibility of financial information. However, the implementation of IPSAS in Moroccan institutions raises a number of issues and challenges, particularly in terms of adapting systems, training staff and managing costs. To deepen our understanding of this topic, we conducted a bibliometric analysis using the VOSviewer tool. This analysis enabled us to identify influential authors, collaborative networks, and the main and emerging themes in IPSAS research. The results show that the implementation of IPSAS helps to ensure good quality and transparency in public sector financial reporting, providing better information for financial management, accountability and decision making. IPSAS, as international accounting standards specific to the public sector, aim to improve the quality of financial reporting by public entities, thereby enabling more reliable resource allocation decisions and contributing to improved financial transparency and accountability. © 2024 by the authors.",0

Chronic inflammation induced by PD may promote the onset and progression of AS through multiple mechanisms. Given the increasing global incidence of both PD and AS, which adversely affects patients’ quality of life and longevity, further investigation into the interplay between PD and AS is of substantial clinical importance. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the association between PD and AS using bibliometric methods. Methods: Articles and reviews on the association between PD and AS were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) on June 1, 2023. Bibliometric and knowledge mapping analyses were conducted using CiteSpace [6.3.R1 (64-bit) Advanced]. Results: Through a bibliometric analysis of the literature published between 2000 and 2023 on the PD-AS relationship, we identified 1,572 relevant studies. The results show a steadily increasing number of studies on this topic annually, with a significant upward trend after 2002. Keyword analysis reveals “atherosclerosis,” “periodontal disease,” “cardiovascular disease,” “Porphyromonas gingivalis,” and “periodontal pathogens” as research hotspots. Collaboration network analysis highlights the United States as the primary contributor to research in this field. Co-citation analysis shows that J Periodontol, J Clin Periodontol, and Circulation are the most frequently cited journals, reflecting their support for research in this area. Document co-citation analysis identifies several high-impact studies focusing on how systemic inflammation induced by periodontitis promotes AS. This study uncovers development trends and research hotspots in the PD-AS relationship and emphasizes the role of international collaboration and high-impact journals in advancing this field. These insights provide valuable references and guidance for future research. Conclusion: PD and AS are global epidemics causing significant distress and imposing a substantial burden. Research on the PD-AS relationship is evolving rapidly and continues to be a critical focus. Elucidating the mechanisms linking PD and AS represents an emerging trend, providing valuable references for future studies. 2024 Chang, Wang, Zhang, Mi, Qiu, Zhao, Wang, Bai and Ren.",0

The studies have provided insights into the local structure of collaboration networks, relations between the team composition and research impact. However, the laws governing research collaboration at the (macro)scale of countries and institutions are yet to be established. In this work, a simple yet unexpectedly accurate logarithmic relation between measures of the research output and self-reliance is demonstrated. Restriction of co-authorship analysis to high-ranking journals suppresses geographical and cultural differences to expose universalities in the international research collaboration. The emerging law holds across research areas; it benchmarks collaboration patterns of research institutions grouped by type or country.

A combination of bibliometrics and social network analysis was used to examine the bibliographic data of 580 documents published on Iranian biomedical ethics in Web of Science and Scopus databases to investigate the publication trend, scientific impact, subject keywords network, and social network analysis indicators for international and cross-institutional co-authorship networks. The results showed that the publication of documents has had a consistent and increasing growth and that the citation trend has grown along with it. The analysis of thematic clusters by keyword co-occurrence network shows that Iranian biomedical ethics research has dealt with various topics and that has introduced different research directions. Researchers from 28 countries were identified in the international collaboration network. The main partners of Iranian researchers were from the US (17.8%) and the UK (9.2%). However, there is a tendency to develop and complete cooperation with researchers from different countries. The cross-institutional collaboration network comprises of 63 institutes, of which Tehran University of Medical Sciences (38%), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (11%) and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (7%) have the largest share in publishing documents. The superiority of the first two universities based on centralization indicators in the cross-institutional collaboration network has caused the exchange of cross-network knowledge between and via these players. The network density indicator shows that almost half of the co-authorship links within the international collaboration network and 8% of the co-authorship links within the cross-institutional collaboration network have been implemented and that these networks are not very coherent. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0

This paper is a review of six international large-scale recurring survey programs with open access to data with regard to their contributions to international research collaborations and publications in psychology. These programs are the International Social Survey Programme, the World Values Survey, Children’s Worlds: International Survey of Children’s Well-Being, the Programme for International Student Assessment, the Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies, and the Skills Toward Employment and Productivity Measurement Programme. Each program is described in terms of the stages of research (planning and standard setting, instrumentation, data-gathering procedures and quality control, data access and user support) and its development and expansion through the years. The ensuing research outputs and journal publications have international authorship and have analyzed the survey data to address broad, international issues in psychology. These programs exemplify features that encourage and facilitate international collaborations and publications in psychology: an international collaborative network that gathers comprehensive data from large nationally diverse samples over the years, provisions for open, unrestricted access to data, survey documentation, and user support. © 2023, Associação Brasileira de Psicologia.",0

The aim of this bibliometric study is to perform a bibliometric indicator analysis of the worldwide academic production of NMOSD during the period 2017-2021. METHODS: A bibliographic search was assessed in the Scopus database to identify NMOSD-related articles published during the period 2017-2021. Collected publications were exported and analyzed in Scival (Elsevier). Bibliographic data were described through absolute values and percentages in descriptive tables. VOSviewer was used to visualize collaborative networks. RESULTS: A total of 1920 documents were collected, and the highest percentage of these belonged to the area of neurology. Friedemann Paul was the author with the highest scientific production, but Brian Weinshenker had the greatest impact worldwide. Three of the institutions with the highest production were North American. Multiple sclerosis and related disorders were the journal with the highest production of publications. Most papers were published in Q1 or Q2 journals. CONCLUSION: NMOSD-related articles are mostly published in first and second quartile journals, which would reflect a high interest of the scientific community. Publications with international collaboration reported a higher impact. Although African and South American regions have considerable prevalence of this disease, they do not have institutions with high productivity developing research on this disease. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Maintaining a comprehensive dataset distribution is crucial to ensure the validity and relevance of these reconstructions on a global scale. This scientometric study aimed to analyze trends in diatom-based paleoenvironmental research on a global scale with an emphasis on South America. This study aimed to investigate disparities in the geographical distribution of diatom-based paleoenvironmental studies, collaboration networks in the field, and regions in which this research is lacking. The Scopus search criteria excluded certain types of publications, such as conference articles and notes. The search focused on articles, reviews, books and chapters of books using specific keywords aligned with the objectives of this study. Using the Scopus database, we identified 7,091 publications (1979- 2023) that employed diatoms as a primary proxy for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The results show significant changes in this field recent decades. The analysis highlights a marked upsurge in publication output during the 1980s and a substantial increase in publications after 2000. This upward trend in scientific documentation reflects the growing interest in and recognition of the importance of this field in the context of palaeoecology and environmental sciences. After 2011, the results revealed a shift in thematic focus from historical and geological reconstruction to ecological, anthropogenic, and climatic interactions. Key researchers, including Smol JP, Leng MJ, and Birks HJB, have been at the forefront of international collaborations. Since the 2000s, South American studies have focused primarily on lakes, climate change effects, and volcanic activity. In this region, researchers such as Maidana N.I., Urrutia, R., and García-Rodriguez, F. emphasized the significance of regional ecosystems and their paleoenvironmental history in the global context of the field. Despite its high biodiversity, South America contributed only 6.7% of the global research output, placing it 19th globally. Socioeconomic factors and other obstacles faced by researchers in the region could explain the observed disparity in scientific output in South America compared to other regions. To unlock South America's vast potential for diatom-based paleoenvironmental research, which boasts the highest global biodiversity yet remains underrepresented in the field, stakeholders must implement equitable partnerships, increase funding and improve their academic infrastructure and opportunities. These strategies are crucial for advancing the global paleoenvironmental understanding, informing future conservation and environmental policies in South America, and promoting scientific progress on a global scale. © 2023 The Author(s).",0

We aim to evaluate the scientific production on OSA from 2009 to 2018 to illustrate its worldwide distribution, topic areas, and ability to secure funding, as well as to describe international collaboration networks in this field. Methods: Articles published between 2009 and 2018 were extracted from the Science Citation Index Expanded via Web of Science (WoS) using the search term “obstructive sleep apn*“. Publication year, number and country of authors, journal, subject category, key words, funding source and number of citations received were recorded. We also conducted network analyses for key words and international collaboration. Results: 12,666 articles on OSA were located, which had increased from 895 documents in 2009 to 1592 in 2018. The progressive growth in scientific production on OSA had outpaced the growth rate of total WoS production since 2012.50% of the articles declared some type of funding, with a citation index higher than manuscripts that were not funded. The manuscripts were distributed in journals from 135 subject categories of the WoS, and keyword distribution showed a dispersed pattern with a high number of nodes. The international collaboration rate was 18.2%, and the country network showed the United States as the hegemonic node. Conclusion: World production on OSA has grown at a higher rate than global production and shows notable thematic dispersion as well as a high ability to secure funding, which increases its impact. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",0
